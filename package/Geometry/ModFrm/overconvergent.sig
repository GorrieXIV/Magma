S,OverconvergentHeckeSeries,"Returns the reverse characteristic series of the U_p operator on the space of p-adic overconvergent modular forms of character eps and weight k for each k in kseq, for each k in kseq, and a p-adic integer used to embed the cyclotomic field Q(char) in the p-adic field. Here kseq is a sequence of integer weights all congruent modulo (p-1). The result is correct modulo (p^m). They are returned as a sequence of polynomials over pAdicRing(p,m) and an element in pAdicRing(p,m)",1,2,1,82,0,148,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,82,,0,0,GrpDrchElt,,0,0,148,,82,396,-38,-38,-38,-38
