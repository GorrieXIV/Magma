S,Corank2Case,"f should be a two-variable non-zero polynomial defining a corank 2 singularity at (0,0). That is, f contains no terms of degree < 3. Returns whether the singularity is one that occurs in Arnold's classification. If so, also returns the normal form f0 of the equation for the singularity and a string containing a label for the family that it lies in. If parameter get_trans is true (default: false), a fourth return value is a polynomial map giving the truncation to a certain precision of an analytic isomorphism from f to f0. This precision is the maximum of parameter d (default: 0) and the default precision for the singularity type as described in the Handbook. The argument f may be the polynomial truncation up to degree fdeg of a power series F that defines the singularity. In this case, data for expanding f to higher degree if necessary should be given by setting parameter fData to the 2-element list [* dat, fdeg *] where dat is a data object of the type described in the Handbook",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,36,63,298,175,-38,-38
