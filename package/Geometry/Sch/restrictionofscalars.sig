S,RestrictionOfScalars,"Given an affine scheme S with base field K, and a field F such that K is a finite extension of F, returns the scheme over F obtained by restricting scalars to F. Also returns the natural map of schemes over K, and maps of pointsets S(K) -> S_res(F) and S_res(F) -> S(K)",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-24,,0,0,380,,380,376,41,175,-38,-38
