S,WeightedAffinePatch,P is weighted projective space with positive integral weights. Constructs the ith affine patch as an affine scheme A and returns this along with the (invertible) projective closure map f: A -> P. This will be a 'standard' Magma affine patch if and only if the weight for the (Rank(P)-i)th variable is 1. NB: f will be defined by several sets of alternative equations but these will still not define f on all of A except in the weight 1 case,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,379,,380,375,-38,-38,-38,-38
