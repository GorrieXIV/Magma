S,IneffectiveDivisorToSheaf,"Returns the invertible sheaf <-> the (locally principal) effective divisor on X defined by ideal I. If GetMax is true (the default), the module computed is the maximal separated one, the associated divisor map is computed and stored and a basis for the Riemann-Roch space is computed and stored at the same time in a slightly more efficient way than for the direct sheaf computation",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,,0,0,64,,0,0,380,,ShfCoh,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,IneffectiveRiemannRochBasis,"Returns a basis for the Riemann-Roch space of the (locally principal) effective divisor D on variety X defined by ideal I. Returned as a sequence [F1,..,Fn] of numerators and a denominator G such that rational functions Fi/G on X give a basis for L(D). An invertible sheaf representing the divisor class of D is also returned",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,,0,0,64,,0,0,380,,82,63,ShfCoh,-38,-38,-38
