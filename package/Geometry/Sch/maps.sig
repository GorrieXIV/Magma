S,IsInvertible,"Determines if phi is birationally invertible. If it is, then true is returned, together with the inverse map (knowing about the original map as its inverse). If not, false is returned. Presently, domain and codomain should be irreducible. It uses a Groebner basis computation, so is potentially expensive. If Maximal is provided, the inverse returned (if any) will have multiple patches installed to maximize its domain of definition. This is not guaranteed to be really maximal. It just makes the extension that is easy from the computed data. Use AlternativePatches to get more",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,376,,36,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
