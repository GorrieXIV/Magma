S,NormalFormOfHypersurfaceSingularity,"The first argument f should be a multivariate polynomial defining an affine hypersurface with an isolated singularity, s, at the origin (0,0,..,0,0). Returns whether s occurs in Arnold's classification of isolated hypersurface singularities. If so, also returns Arnold's normal form for s and a string giving the name of the family in which s lies (e.g. ""Y^1_{3,2}""). If parameter get_trans is set to true (default: false), a polynomial map giving an explicit transformation from f to the normal form up to a certain precision is also returned as a final value. The precision is the smallest required to uniquely determine the normal form unless integer parameter d (default:0) is positive. In that case, the transformation precision is such that it takes f to the normal form up to polynomial terms of degree at least d+1. The (analytic) hypersurface may be defined by a power series F with F=f+terms of degree fdeg+1 or higher. In that case, parameter fData should be used as described in the Handbook to give fdeg and a data structure that allows F to be expanded to higher precision if necessary",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,36,63,298,175,-38,-38
