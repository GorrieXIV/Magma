S,SegreProduct,Xs is a sequence of ordinary projective schemes. Computes the direct product scheme embedded in ordinary projective space via the Segre embedding. Returns the result along with a sequence of scheme maps giving the projections back to the Xs[i],1,0,1,82,0,380,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,380,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,SegreEmbedding,X should be a scheme lying in a product projective space. Computes and returns the image Y of X under the Segre embedding into ordinary projective space and an isomorphism of X to Y,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,380,,380,375,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,Blowup,"The blowup of scheme X along subscheme Y. X should be affine, ordinary projective or product projective. If parameter Ordinary is true and X is projective, the result is Segre-embedded into ordinary projective space. Otherwise, the result will lie in an ambient that is the direct product of the ambient of X with an ordinary projective space",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,380,,0,0,380,,380,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,Blowup,"The blowup of scheme X at the point p (and all of its conjugates) of X(K). X should be affine, ordinary projective or product projective.
