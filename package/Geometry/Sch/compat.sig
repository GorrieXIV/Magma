S,IsNonSingular,"True iff X is nonsingular (strictly, smooth over the base ring). If FullCheck is false (the default), it is assumed that X is equidimensional. Otherwise the potentially expensive decomposition into equidimensional components is performed and the Jacobi criterion applied to each component",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,380,,36,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
