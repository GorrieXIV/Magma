S,Reduction,"Compute the reduction of the D divisor modulo p. D should be the divisor on a scheme defined over the rationals or a number field K, and p a prime or place of K or prime ideal in an order of K. If the reduction of the ambient variety mod p is already known, it can be given as parent",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,DivSchElt,,DivSchElt,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
