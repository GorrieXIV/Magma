S,SetRationalBasis,"For a space M of Hilbert modular forms over a number field K, this resets the basis of the space to be such that the Hecke operators are matrices with entries in the smallest field possible. (In parallel weight, this is Rationals(). In general, it is a subfield of the splitting field of K.) The basis is then fixed, and all subsequent computations with M will be done relative to this basis",0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,ModFrmHil,,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38

S,DecompositionOldAndNew,"Decomposition of the Hecke module M as a direct sum of the 'oldspace' relative to M0 (the largest Hecke submodule of M whose irreducible submodules appear in M0), and the complementary submodule. These are returned as subspaces of the underlying vector space of M. Both M and M0 are assumed to be semisimple, and to satisfy the same properties regarding dimensions of old and new spaces that hold for modular forms. At least one of the optional arguments ('old_dimension' or 'primes' or 'bound') must be provided. The routine will terminate as soon as any of the following hold: (i) the dimension of the oldspace is <= the specified 'old_dimension', (ii) the Hecke action for all specified 'primes' has been used (or if 'primes' are not specified, all good primes with norm up to the specified 'bound')",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,-1,,159,159,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,NewAndOldSubspacesUsingHeckeAction,"Given a Hecke module M of level N and a prime p, this returns the p-new subspace of M, and the p-old subspace, as subspaces of the underlying vector space of M. By definition, the p-old subspace is the space spanned by all images in M of the space Mp of level N/p. It is obtained by computing the dimensions of all oldspaces, and computing the Hecke action on M and Mp for sufficiently many primes. M is assumed to be semisimple, and to satisfy the same properties regarding dimensions of old and new spaces that hold for modular forms",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,-1,,-1,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
