S,DiagonalForm,A (carefully chosen) diagonal form of the equation of the plane conic C defined over a number field. Also returns the transformation matrix,1,0,1,326,0,-9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,326,,63,-34,82,-38,-38,-38
S,HasRationalPoint,"True iff the conic curve C has a point over its ground field. If true, also returns one point. The conic may be over the rationals, the integers, a number field, a finite field, or a rational function field",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,326,,36,377,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,RationalPoint,"A point on the conic C over its ground field, if one exists. The conic may be over the rationals, the integers, a number field, a finite field, or a rational function field",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,326,,377,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
