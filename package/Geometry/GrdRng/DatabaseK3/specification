	    Specification of records for the K3 database
	    ============================================

The .dat and .ind files for the K3 database is created from a sequence
of magma records.

Such records r have 9 fields as follows:  (notation described below)

r`identifier
    MedPosInt		(in fact, in the range 1..7000)

r`genus1to5
    [ MedPosInt ]	this sequence always has length 5

r`weights
    [ SmallPosInt ]	this sequence has unknown length, but less than 255

r`basket
    [ [SmallPosInt] ]	this sequence has unknown length; each sequence it
			contains has length exactly 2: for example
				[ [2,1], [3,1], [19,5] ]

r`numinfo
    [ [MedPosInt] ]	this sequence has length 3; the first two subsequences
			have unknown length (less than 255) while the third
			always has length 2

r`noether
    [ SmallPosInt ]	this sequence is always length 3

r`numerator
    [ MedPosIntElt ]	[ MedPosIntElt ] (of small int length) for this field
    
r`projinds
    [ MedPosInt ]	sequence has unknown small length

r`projdata
    [ [ SmallPosInt ] ]	sequence has same (unknown, small) length as the
			field r`projinds;  each subsequence has length
			exactly 5

Notation
--------
Magma typenames are used.  Thus,
    RngIntElt denotes an integer,
    [RngIntElt] denotes a sequence of integers.

We abuse this notation in different ways:
    abbreviation:
	Int	stands for RngIntElt
	Seq	stands for SeqEnum
    with extra information:
	SmallInt	-- integers in range 0..255
	SmallInt	-- integers in range -127..128
	MedPosInt	-- integers in range 0..65535
    for sequences of sequences:
	[ [SmallPosInt] ]  -- a sequence comprising sequences of small ints
