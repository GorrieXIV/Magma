S,MinimalRGenerators,"The minimal generators of the cone C. If C is full dimensional then these are the rays of C. The parameter 'algorithm' specifies the algorithm that will be used for calculations: if set to ""auto"" (default) Magma will choose the algorithm to execute; ""FM"" will use Fourier-Motzkin elimination; ""silly"" checks nearly every hyperplane spanned by dim(C) - 1 generators/inequalities; ""simplex"" works only for simplicial cones",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,TorCon,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
