S,ComponentGroupOrder,"The order of the component group at p. This is the order of the group of Fpbar-points of the component group of the reduction modulo p of the Neron model of the abelian variety attached to M. At present, it is necessary that p exactly divides the level. If Sign(M) is not equal to 0, then only the odd part of the order is returned",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,ModSym,,148,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
