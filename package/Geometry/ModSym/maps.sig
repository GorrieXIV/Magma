S,DegeneracyMap,"The degneracy map M_1 ---> M_2 associated to d. Let N_i be the level of M_i for i=1,2. Suppose that d is a divisor of either the numerator or denominator of the rational number N_1/N_2, written in reduced form. If N_1 divides N_2, then this intrinsic returns alpha_d : M_1 ---> M_2, or if N_2 divides N_1, then this intrinsic returns beta_d : M_1 ---> M_2. It is an error if neither divisibility holds. There is also a condition about Dirichlet characters",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,ModSym,,0,0,ModSym,,175,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
