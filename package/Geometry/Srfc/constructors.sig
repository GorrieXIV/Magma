S,RationalRuledSurface,"Returns the rational ruled surface X (scroll) with parameters n,m-1-n in the ordinary projective space P of dimension m. Also returns the map from X to P^1 whose fibres are the lines giving the ruling on X",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,379,,381,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,RandomCompleteIntersection,"Returns a complete intersection scheme in ordinary projective space P defined by random homogeneous polynomials of degrees ds[1],..,ds[n]. If parameter Nonsingular is true (the default), a non-singular scheme will always be returned. The base field must be the rationals or a finite field. If it is the rationals, the coefficients of the polynomials will be random integers of absolute value <= parameter RndP, which has the default value 1",1,1,1,82,0,148,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,0,0,379,,380,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
