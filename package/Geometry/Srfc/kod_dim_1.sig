S,MinimalModelKodairaDimensionOne,"Computes and returns a birational map to a minimal model Y for non-singular ordinary projective surface X of Kodaira dimension one. If parameter Fibration is true (the default is false), also returns a fibration map from Y to a smooth curve C that presents Y as a (minimal) elliptic fibration over C",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,381,,175,175,-38,-38,-38,-38
