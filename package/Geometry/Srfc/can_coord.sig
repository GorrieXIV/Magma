S,CanonicalWeightedModel,Returns a birational map to the full (weighted) canonical model of an ordinary projective surface X of general type with only simple singularities. Second return value is true if and only if X is already minimal in the sense of having no (-1) curves,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,381,,175,36,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,CanonicalCoordinateIdeal,"For an ordinary projective surface X of general type with only simple singularities, returns the canonical ideal I. This is the ideal in a weighted polynomial ring R such that R/I is isomorphic to the full canonical coordinate ring of X",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,381,,175,36,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,MinimalModelGeneralType,Returns a birational map to a minimal model (with (-2)-curves contracted) of an ordinary projective surface X of general type with only simple singularities. Second return value is true if and only if X is already minimal in the sense of having no (-1) curves. See CanonicalWeightedModel for a better model,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,381,,175,36,-38,-38,-38,-38
