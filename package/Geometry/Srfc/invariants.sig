S,HomAdjoints,"Given a (generally singular) surface S in P^3 and integers m and n. Returns a basis for the vector space of '(m,n)'-adjoints : a subspace of homogeneous degree (m-4)*Degree(S)+n polynomials representing the global sections of invertible sheaf K^m(nH) on a desingularisation.

S,IsRational,"Given an ordinary projective surface S returns whether the surface is rational. S should either have only simple singularities or lie in 'P^3' (when desingularization to compute plurigenera is used). In the former case, the singularity condition is only checked if the 'CheckADE' parameter is set to true. In the latter case, if S is singular and desingularization data has not already been computed and stored, this is computed first",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,381,,36,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
