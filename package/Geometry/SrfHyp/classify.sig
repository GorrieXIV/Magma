S,ClassifyRationalSurface,"S should be a (generally singular) surface in P^3. Classifies S into either not (geometrically) rational or rational and birationally isomorphic to a rational surface Y of special type over the base field. The first return value is S in the first case or Y in the second. The second return value is a list of 1 or 2 maps. The first is a birational map of S to itself or Y. There is only a second when Y is a rational scroll or conic bundle, when the second map gives the corresponding fibration map from S to a rational normal curve. The third return value is a string that giving an English language description of the type of Y (e.g. ""Del Pezzo degree >= 3"") or ""Not rational"". S should be defined over a number field or have only point singularities. A resolution of singularities, either of formal or blow-up type is needed here and it is computed at the start if one has not already been stored for S. To force the use of a formal desingularisation rather than a blow-up one (the default) in the case where S has only point singularities and the base field is a number field, set parameter UseFormalDesing to true",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,381,,381,168,298,-38,-38,-38

'p(X,Y,Z) = 0' and s.t. the Jacobian of '[X,Y,Z]' has generically rank 2. Moreover every other such parametrization is obtained by applying an endomorphism of 'F'.
