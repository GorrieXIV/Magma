S,ProjKilling,"Project an element onto a subalgebra. This is useful for constructing new representations from old ones. x must be an element in a semisimple Lie algebra, and sa must be a subalgebra where the Killing form is nondegenerate. Otherwise an error is produced by inverting xfer",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,15,,0,0,16,,16,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
