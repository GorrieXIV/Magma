S,ResolveAffineCurve,"Compute an embedded (piecewise) resolution of a curve (defined by the non-zero bivariate polynomial 'p' over the rational numbers or over a number field) using a succession of point blow ups. Only the part of the curve in the zero set of the ideal 'Focus' is considered. If known, a factorization of 'p' (as returned by 'Factorization') can be passed through the parameter 'Factors' and its squarefree part (as returned by 'SquarefreePart') can be passed through 'Ps'. Let '[* [* b1, <y, mult11>, <p1, mult12> *] ... *], [* [* b2, <y, mult2> *] ... *], [* [* b3, <p3, mult3> *] ... *]' be the returned lists. Here 'b1', 'b2' and 'b3' are maps to some bivariate polynomial ring representing a chart that arose during the resolution procedure. The integer values 'mult11' and 'mult2' give the multiplicity of the exceptional divisor 'y=0' in the respective chart. The first list gathers normal crossings. The polynomial 'p1' is the (irreducible) equation of a component that meets 'y=0' in the origin of the respective chart and 'mult12' is its multiplicity. The second list just gathers exceptional divisors. (Note that one and the same geometric exceptional divisor might show up several times in the first list.) Finally, the last list contains the defining equations 'p3' of all original curve components with multiplicites (more precisely, those in the zero set of 'Focus'). The two first lists are complete in the sense that they contain all exceptional divisors that would show up in a complete embedded resolution and all normal crossings of the transformed curve and these exceptional divisors (always up to conjugates). If the ground field has to be extended, the algebraic elements will be displayed as 'ExtName_i' where 'i' starts from 'ExtCount'. The last return value is the value of 'ExtCount' plus the number of field extensions that have been introduced during the computation",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,168,168,168,148,-38,-38
