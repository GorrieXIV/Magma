S,Chabauty,"Computes the points in the image of MWmap that map to a rational point under Ecov. using a combination of Mordell-Weil sieving and Chabauty's method. Several parameters are available to influence the performance. InertiaDegreeBound: The routine considers many reductions of the elliptic curve. The size of the residue field is an important factor in the cost. No primes with an inertia degree exceeding this bound will be considered. SmoothBound: Only primes at which the elliptic curve has a smooth group order are considered PrimeBound: In the Mordell-Weil sieving stage, only prime factors below this bound will be added to the group order. IndexBound: The routine finds all points in the Mordell-Weil group with rational image provided the image of MWmap is saturated at certain primes. Setting this bound ensures that the routine will only use information that depends on the image being p-saturated for p dividing IndexBound. Setting this bound can make it impossible for the routine to complete. InitialPrimes: Information at all good primes below this bound will be used initially",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,376,,0,0,175,,36,83,-38,-38,-38,-38
