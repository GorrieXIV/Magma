A,RngOrd,1,StandardPrimeIdeals
S,LookupPrime,Routine to get *IDENTICAL* prime ideals for a number field. Calling this routine several times with equal prime ideals of the same order is guaranteed to return identical prime ideals. This enables attributes to be stored in prime ideals and preserved along different instantiations of that prime ideal,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,217,,217,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,MyCompletion,"Returns a completion with memory. If precision is given and is different from a stored completion, then stored field will be changed (recreated)",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,217,,400,175,-38,-38,-38,-38

S,SafeUniformiser,returns an element of valuation 1 at the given prime and of valuation 0 at the other primes over the same rational prime,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,217,,216,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,SafeUniformiser,"For a prime ideal I of a maximal order in a function field, this returns an element which has valuation 1 at the given prime and which has valuation 0 at all other primes lying over the same prime of the underlying rational function field",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,10,,9,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
