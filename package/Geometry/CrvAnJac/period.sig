S,AnalyticJacobian,"This computes analytic data for computation with the jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve defined over a subfield of the complex numbers. In particular it computes the period matrix of the curve, but also the integral to infinity from a certain base point. This makes later computations faster",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,338,,AnHcJac,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
