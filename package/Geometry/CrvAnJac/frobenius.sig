S,FrobeniusFormAlternating,"Given an non-singular 2nx2n integer alternating matrix M, this returns the Frobenius form of M. That is, a block matrix C = [0, D; -D, 0], where D is a diagonal matrix with positive diagonal entries d_i satisfying d_1 | d_2 | ... | d_n. The second return value is the change of basis matrix B, such that B*M*B^t = C",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,177,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
