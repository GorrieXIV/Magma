S,IntersectionNumbers,"A and B should be relatively prime homogeneous polynomials in the same 3-variable polynomial ring k[x,y,z] over a finite or number field. Returns the cycle of the intersection of the curves A=0 and B=0 as a list of pairs <p,m> where p is polynomial data defining a set of conjugate points in the intersection (as described in the handbook) and m is the intersection multiplicity at these points. By default, non-global uni- and bi-variate polynomial rings are used for the elements of p. The Global parameter can be set to true if global versions of these rings are preferred",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,0,0,63,,168,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,IntersectionNumbers,"C and D should be curves with no common component in the same ordinary projective plane P2 over a finite field or number field k. Returns the cycle of intersection of C and D as a list of pairs <p,m> where p is a point in P2(K) for a finite extension K of k and m is the intersection multiplicity of C and D at p",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,409,,0,0,409,,168,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
