S,IndexCalculusMatrix,"Matrix for index calculus to find the dlog of D2-Deg(D2)*D0 with base D1-Deg(D1)*D0. Use a factor base of size approximately n, and try to find rr relations. Return M,pos,fb,Da,Db,a,b where M is the matrix with relations. Da and Db are divisors that split over the factor base, and Da-Deg(Da)*D0 and Db-Deg(Db)-D0 are linearly equivalent to a*(D1-Deg(D1)*D0) and b*(D2-Deg(D2)*D0), respectively. fb is a sequence of points that contains the support of Da, Db and D0. pos is a sequence of integers that indicates the position of the points of fb in the factor base. The last two rows of M correspond to the divisors Da-Deg(Da)*D0 and Db-Deg(Db)*D0",0,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,148,,0,0,61,,0,0,61,,0,0,61,,93,82,-38,-38,-38,-38
