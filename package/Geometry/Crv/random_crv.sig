S,RandomPlaneCurve,"Finds a random plane curve in the proj plane P of degree d with prescribed ordinary singularities (sings[1] double points, sings[2] triple points etc.). If parameter Adjoint is true then, the adjoint ideal is also computed and returned returned. If parameter Proof is true then the produced curve is definitely tested to have no worse singularities than specified. Otherwise this may not be true",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,379,,0,0,82,,0,0,148,,409,64,-38,-38,-38,-38
