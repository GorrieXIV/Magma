S,Genus6GonalMap,"Computes smallest degree (gonal) maps to P^1 for a genus 6 curve, possibly over a finite extension of the base field. Returns the gonality, a secondary type number, and a map if DataOnly is false. The type number (1,2,3) is only relevant for gonality 4. In the gonality 4 case, also returns a degree 2 cover of a genus 1 curve (type 2) or an isomorphism to a plane quintic (type 3). If C is a canonical curve in ordinary projective space, IsCanonical should be set to true for efficiency",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,371,,148,148,376,376,-38,-38
S,Genus6PlaneCurveModel,"Returns a birational map to a degree 5 or 6 plane curve (maybe over an extension of the base field) from genus 6 curve C, when C is 4-gonal and not a double cover of a genus 1 curve. The first return value is whether C is of the correct type and the second is the map if so. If C is a canonical curve in ordinary projective space, IsCanonical should be set to true for efficiency",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,371,,36,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
