S,Genus5GonalMap,"Computes smallest degree (gonal) maps to P^1 for a genus 5 curve, possibly over a finite extension of the base field. Returns the gonality and a map if DataOnly is false. Also returns the curve X parametrising degree 4 maps and a function taking points on X to degree 4 maps in the gonality 4 case. If C is a canonical curve in ordinary projective space, IsCanonical should be set to true for efficiency",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,371,,148,376,371,41,-38,-38
S,Genus5PlaneCurveModel,"Looks for a birational map to a degree 5 or 6 plane curve from genus 5 curve C, when C is trigonal or 4-gonal and not a double cover of a genus 1 curve. The first return value is whether C is of the correct type and a map has been found and the second is the map if so. If C is a canonical curve in ordinary projective space, IsCanonical should be set to true for efficiency",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,371,,36,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,Genus5PlaneCurveModel,"Returns a birational map to a degree 5 or 6 plane curve from genus 5 curve C, when C is trigonal or 4-gonal and not a double cover of a genus 1 curve. p should be a non-singular point on C, rational over the base field, which is used in the 4-gonal case. The first return value is whether C is of the correct type and the second is the map if so. If C is a canonical curve in ordinary projective space, IsCanonical should be set to true for efficiency",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,377,,0,0,371,,36,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,Genus5PlaneCurveModel,"Returns a birational map to a degree 5 or 6 plane curve from genus 5 curve C, when C is trigonal or 4-gonal and not a double cover of a genus 1 curve. Z should be a subscheme of C defining a divisor of degree 2 in the non-singular locus of C, which is used in the 4-gonal case. The first return value is whether C is of the correct type and the second is the map if so. If C is a canonical curve in ordinary projective space, IsCanonical should be set to true for efficiency",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,380,,0,0,371,,36,376,-38,-38,-38,-38
