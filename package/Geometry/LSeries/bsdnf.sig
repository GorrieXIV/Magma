S,ConjecturalRegulator,"For an elliptic curve over a number field, this returns (approximately) the conjectural value of Regulator*|Sha| according to the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. The analytic rank is also returned. 'Precision' is used to decide which derivatives are zero (in determining the rank)",1,0,1,334,0,27,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,334,,402,148,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,ConjecturalSha,"For an elliptic curve over a number field K, this returns an approximate value for #Sha(E) computed analytically, assuing the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture and assuming that the given points generate E(K) modulo torsion. (More precisely: returns 0 if the subgroup <pts> has rank smaller than the analytic rank, otherwise returns #Sha(E)/I^2 where I is the index of <pts> as a subgroup of E(K)/E_tors",2,0,1,334,0,27,1,1,-52,0,372,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-52,,0,0,334,,402,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
