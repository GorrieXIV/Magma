S,TensorProduct,"For L-series L1=L(V1), L2=L(V2), associated to l-adic representations V1 and V2 (a la Serre), compute their tensor product L(V1 tensor V2). ExcFactors is a list of tuples, each of the form <p,v> or <p,v,F_p(x)> that give, for primes p where both L1 and L2 have bad reduction, the valuation v of the conductor of (V1 tensor V2) at p and the inverse local factor at p. If the data is not provided for such a prime p, e.g. if you call TensorProduct(L1,L2,[]), Magma will attempt to compute the local factors by assuming that the inertia invariants behave well at p, (V1 tensor V2)^(I_p) = V1^(I_p) tensor V2^(I_p). It will also compute the conductor exponents by predicting the tame and wild degrees from the degrees of the local factors [This is not guaranteed to work correctly, so use CheckFunctionalEquation to verify it.] You may provide the sign of L(V1 tensor V2) if you happen to know it.
