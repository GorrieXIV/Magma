S,FixedPoints,"returns the fixed points of the action of g on the upperhalf plane H. This is either a sequence of at most 2 points, which are in the closure of H (under the complex topology) or a sequence containing H, in the case of g being the identity",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,SpcHyp,,0,0,GrpPSL2Elt,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
