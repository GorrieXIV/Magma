S,FindWord,"given a congruence subgroup G, and an element g in G, this function computes g in terms of the generators of G. The generators of G are those given by the function Generators(G). Denote this sequence by ""Gen"" This function returns a sequence of integers [a_1,a_2,....a_m] such that g = Gen[Abs(a_1)]^Sign(a_1)*...*Gen[Abs(a_m)]^Sign(a_m)",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,GrpPSL2Elt,,0,0,GrpPSL2,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
