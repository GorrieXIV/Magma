S,TwoDescent,"A sequence of reduced 2-covering curves of the form y^2=quartic(x), corresponding to the nontrivial elements of the 2-Selmer group of E. If the option 'WithMaps' is set to true, the second object returned is a corresponding list of maps from each 2-covering curve to E. The third object returned is a map (with inverse) from an abstract group to the sequence of 2-coverings: this abstract group is either TwoSelmerGroup(E), or a quotient if RemoveTorsion or RemoveGens were specified",1,0,1,334,0,-9,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,334,,82,168,175,-38,-38,-38
S,TwoIsogenyDescent,"Given an elliptic curve E admitting a 2-isogeny phi E'->E, computes 2-coverings representing the nontrivial elements of the Selmer groups of phi and of the dual isogeny phi' E->E'. These coverings are given as hyperelliptic curves C: y^2=quartic(x). Six objects are returned: the sequence of coverings C of E for phi followed by the corresponding list of maps C->E, then similarly the coverings and maps C'->E' for phi', and finally phi and phi'. It's advisable to give a model for E that is nearly minimal",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,334,,82,168,82,168,376,376

S,LiftDescendant,"Given a hyperelliptic curve of the form C : y^2 = d1x^4+cx^2+d2, let E be the elliptic curve y^2 = x(x^2+cx+d) where d=d1*d2. Then E admits a 2-isogeny and C admits a two-to-one map to E, which is a ""covering arising in 2-isogeny descent on E"". Return the locally soluble coverings D of C that arise in a full 2-descent on E, together with a list of the corresponding covering maps D -> C, and thirdly the covering map C -> E.
