S,QuadraticTwist,"The quadratic twist of E by d. If j(E) != 1728, this is isomorphic to E precisely over the field extension determined by d (maybe trivial). In the 1728 case, d may define a non-trivial extension but the twist can still be isomorphic to E over the base field",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-45,,0,0,334,,334,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
