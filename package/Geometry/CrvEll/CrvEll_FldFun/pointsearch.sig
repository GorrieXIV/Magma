S,WeakPopovForm,Returns a weak Popov form matrix N together with the transformation matrix taking M to N,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-34,,-34,-34,148,-38,-38,-38
S,PointsQI,Returns all points of degree <= H on the quadric-intersection C (over a rational function field),1,0,1,371,0,239,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,371,,151,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38

S,Points,Search for points on the hyperelliptic curve C (defined over a rational function field). The 'Bound' MUST be given; the routine searches for points whose affine x-coordinates have height (= degree) at most this bound (however it may not find all such points),1,0,1,338,0,239,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,338,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
