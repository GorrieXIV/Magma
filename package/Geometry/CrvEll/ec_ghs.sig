S,WeilDescent,"E/K an ordinary elliptic curve over a characteristic 2 finite field. k a subfield of K. Function calculates a plane curve model C for the GHS Weil Descent associated to E and the parameter c in K. Also returned is the divisor map taking points of E (considered as degree 1 divisors) to the corresponding divisor on C - unless HyperellipticImage is true (the default),the degree of C is 2 and the Jacobian of C, J, has a group law. In this case,C is returned as a hyperelliptic curve and the map is from points of E (considered as degree 0 divisor CLASSES) to J, the image again representing the image divisor CLASS",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,85,,0,0,84,,0,0,334,,409,175,-38,-38,-38,-38
