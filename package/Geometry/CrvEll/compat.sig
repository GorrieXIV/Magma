S,IsEllipticCurve,"Given a hyperelliptic curve, the function decides whether C has degree 3. When true, the function also returns $C$ as an elliptic curve, and isomorphisms between the two. This function is deprecated and will be removed in a later release. Instead, use Degree(C) eq 3, and EllipticCurve(C)",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,338,,36,334,375,375,-38,-38
