This file is for recording the most recent 
changes in the HC package files.

We'll need a running summary of the most recent changes 
made in those files to allow for a not too
painful updating of these files concurrently
with M. Stoll's files.

A summary of changes will help us updating our files
without losing our most recent changes.
It will also help M. Stoll in getting an overview
of what we were up to.

So please, anytime you make any change, do record
it here as well. 
Thank you.

I think of a format like:

when (date of change)
who (made the change)
where (file)
what (intrinsic/function + brief description)

The person who updates the files from M. Stoll's
latest version should then indicate something like:

****  31/05/01 - M. Stoll's new version - Paulette

13/7/01	nicole	3descent.m	mul and IsSquare - comments as to obsoleteness

20/09/01   isomorphisms.m
           models.m
	   selmer.m
	   reduce.m           Stoll's latest update
