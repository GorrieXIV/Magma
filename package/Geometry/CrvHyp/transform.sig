S,IsGL2Equivalent,"f1 and f2 are considered as homogeneous polynomials of degree n. It is checked whether they belong to the same GL(2,k)-orbit, where k is the coefficient field, modulo multiplication by scalars. As a second value, a sequence of matrix entries [a,b,c,d] is returned such that f2(x) = const * (c*x + d)^n * f1((a*x + b)/(c*x + d)).
