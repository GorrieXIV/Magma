S,IsGeometricallyHyperelliptic,"Determines whether curve C is a hyperelliptic curve over the algebraic closure of its base field. If so and Map is true, a plane conic or the projective line (if genus(C) is odd or even) and a degree 2 map from C to it (all defined over the base field) are also returned",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,371,,36,371,376,-38,-38,-38
S,IsHyperelliptic,"Determines whether curve C is hyperelliptic over its base field, K, (ie has a degree 2 map to the projective line defined over K). If so, and the Eqn parameter is true, also returns a CrvHyp, H, over K and an isomorphic scheme map from C to H",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,371,,36,338,376,-38,-38,-38
