S,LocalIntersectionData,The non-archimedean local intersections used to compute the canonical or p-adic height pairing of points P and Q on a hyperelliptic Jacobian. The base field must be the rationals or a number field and the positive parts of the canonical representatives of the points must have disjoint support,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,153,,0,0,153,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,HeightPairing,"The canonical height pairing of points P and Q on a hyperelliptic Jacobian. This is defined as (h(P+Q) - h(P) - h(Q))/2, where h is the canonical height. The base field must be the rationals or a number field, or a rational function field in the genus 2 case",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,153,,0,0,153,,402,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,CanonicalHeight,"The canonical height of the point P on the Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, which may be defined over the rationals, a number field or a univariate function field",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,153,,402,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,HeightPairingMatrix,"Given a sequence of points P_i on a Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve, this returns the matrix (<P_i, P_j>), where < , > is the canonical height pairing",1,0,1,82,0,153,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,176,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
