S,TwoTorsionSubgroup,The rational 2-torsion subgroup of J for curves of genus 2 in simplified model,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,152,,107,175,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,TorsionSubgroup,Finds the rational torsion subgroup of J. The curve of J must have genus 2 and be defined over the rationals and have form y^2 = f(x) with integral coefficients. Second value gives the map from the group into J,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,152,,107,175,-38,-38,-38,-38
