S,HeightConstant,"If J is the Jacobian of a gneus 2 curve defined over the rationals, of the form y^2 = f(x) with integral coefficients, this computes a real number c such that h_K(P) le h(P) + c for all P in J(Q), where h_K is the naive logarithmic height got from the Kummer surface and h is the canonical height on J. Effort is some specification as to how much effort should be put into getting a good bound. The second value returned is a bound for mu_infinity. If Factor is set to true, the discriminant will be factored, and its prime divisors will be considered individually. This usually results in an improvement of the bound",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,152,,402,402,-38,-38,-38,-38
