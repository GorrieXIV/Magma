S,Chabauty,"For a curve C of genus 2 over Q, this returns the full set of rational points, using Chabauty's method combined with a Mordell-Weil sieve. There are two conditions: (i) the Jacobian of C has rank 1 and the given point ptJ has infinite order, and (ii) the set of rational points on C is non-empty. The optional argument ptC, if given, should be a rational point on C. If Saturate is set to false, then it is assumed that ptJ generates the free part of the Mordell-Weil group and the computation is faster. If the assumption does not hold, then the result may be incorrect in this case",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,153,,83,83,82,-38,-38,-38
