S,HyperellipticCurveFromIgusaClebsch,Try to build a curve of genus 2 with the given Igusa-Clebsch invariants by Mestre's algorithm (and Cardona's in case of non-hyperelliptic involutions) defined over the field in which the invariants lie. Currently this field must be the rationals or a finite field of characteristic bigger than 5. In case such a curve does not exist a curve defined over some quadratic extension is returned,1,0,1,82,0,-25,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,338,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
