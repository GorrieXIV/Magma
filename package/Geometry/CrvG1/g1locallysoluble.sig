S,IsLocallySolvable,"Determines whether there is a Q_p-point on the given genus one model defined over Q. The model should be non-singular. If true, then a Q_p-point is also returned. If Transformation is true then the second returned argument is instead a transformation tr such that tr*model has a smooth point mod p",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,493,,36,-1,-38,-38,-38,-38
