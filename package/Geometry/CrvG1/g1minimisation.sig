S,Minimise,"A minimal model of the given genus one model. Implemented for models of degree 2,3,4 or 5 over Q, and for models of degree 2 over number fields. Also returns the transformation (unless Transformation := false), and the set of primes p where the minimal model has positive level. If UsePrimes is specified, the model is minimised only at these primes. In the number field case, a globally minimal model may not exist, but the returned model is as close to minimal as possible (in particular, if ClassGroupPrimes are specified, it is minimal at all other primes)",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,493,,493,TransG1,83,-38,-38,-38
S,GenusOneModel,"Given a point P on an elliptic curve E over Q, and n = 2,3,4 or 5, maps E to P^{n-1} via the complete linear system |(n-1).O+P| and returns the corresponding genus one model of degree n. The formulae used give a genus one model that is minimised and is close to being reduced. Finally the function Reduce is called (unless NoReduction = true). The second returned value is a point on the covering curve that maps down to P (or -P)",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,372,,0,0,148,,493,377,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,Minimise,"Minimise the ternary cubic form C (which should have rational coefficients). Returns the minimised form, and a matrix M and scaling factor c to specify the transformation (such that the minimised cubic is c times the original cubic evaluated at [x,y,z]*M)",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,63,303,-38,-38,-38,-38
