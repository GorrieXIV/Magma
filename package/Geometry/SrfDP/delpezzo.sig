S,DelPezzoSurface,The del Pezzo surface of degree 3 defined by the cubic form f,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,66,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,IsDelPezzo,"True iff Y is a del Pezzo surface. If true, also returns the image X of the standard (pluri-)anticanonical embedding of Y, and the map Y -> X",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,380,,36,66,376,-38,-38,-38
S,DelPezzoSurface,The smooth del Pezzo surface of degree (9-r) obtained as the blowup of the r (< 9) points of the zero-dimensional scheme Z in an ordinary projective plane,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,370,,66,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38

S,ColinearPointsOnPlane,Takes the set of points S and returns enumerated sequences of (3 or more) colinear points,1,1,1,151,0,377,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,151,,0,0,379,,82,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,PointsInGeneralPosition,"True iff the (8 or less) points of S are in general position. General position means: no 3 are colinear, no 6 lie on a conic and no 8 lie on a cubic with a double point at one of them. If the option NonGenPts is true, also returns the sets of colinear points, the sets of co-conic points, and the eight points, if these configurations exist",1,1,1,151,0,377,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,151,,0,0,379,,36,82,82,82,-38,-38
S,EckardtPoints,Computes the Eckardt points of the Del Pezzo surface X. (These are the points where three coplanar lines meet.) The zero-dimensional scheme of the points is returned,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,66,,380,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
