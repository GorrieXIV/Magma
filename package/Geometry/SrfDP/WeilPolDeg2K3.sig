S,WeilPolynomialOfDegree2K3Surface,"The Weil polynomial of the K3 surface w^2 = f6(x,y,z). Here, f6 is a sextic form in F_p[X,Y,Z]. The Weil polynomial is returned as two factors. The first factor is obtained for a naive point count on the potentially singular model. The second factor corresponds to the Frobenius action on the space spanned by exceptional divisors obtained by desingularization. In case the singularities are not of ADE type both return values will be zero. In case the Galois action on the singularities is to complex for the current implementation the second return value is zero",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,63,,312,312,-38,-38,-38,-38
