S,Implicitization,Assumes that phi is a parametrization of a variety defined by equations y_i = f_i(x_i) where the x_i are in the CODOMAIN of phi and the y_i are in the DOMAIN of phi. Returns the smallest variety containing the points defined by these equations,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,175,,64,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
