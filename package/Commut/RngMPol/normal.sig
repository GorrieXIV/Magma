S,Normalisation,"Computes the integral closure, C, of P/I in its total ring of fractions where P is Generic(I) and I is assumed to be radical. The result is a list of <I_i,mp_i> such that C is the direct sum of Generic(I_i)/I_i and mp_i gives the map from P to Generic(I_i) inducing P/I -> C",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,,168,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
