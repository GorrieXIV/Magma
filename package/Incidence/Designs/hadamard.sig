S,IsHadamardEquivalent,True iff the two Hadamard matrices are equivalent. If so (and the nauty algorithm is used) then transformation matrices X and Y are returned such that H2 = X*H1*Y,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,177,,0,0,177,,36,177,177,-38,-38,-38
S,HadamardMatrixToInteger,Returns an integer encoding the entries of the Hadamard matrix,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,177,,148,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,HadamardMatrixFromInteger,Returns a Hadamard matrix of dimension n as encoded by the integer x,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,148,,177,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
