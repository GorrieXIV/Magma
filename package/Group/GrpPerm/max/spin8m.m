Construction of Spin_8^-(q) - by John Bray
*/

// Two visible submodules generated by V.i, i in {1,4,6,7,10,11,13,16} and {2,3,5,8,9,12,14,15}.
// x23o only required when q=3.
// x1, x7, x8 to the same named elements in Spin_8^+(q) construction.
// x4 vaguely correponds to element named x4 in Spin_8^+(q) construction, but has order q+1 instead of q-1.
// x23 corresponds to x2*x3^-1 in Spin_8^+(q) construction, and x23o is also in <x2,x3>.
// x26 and x46 correspond to the elements x2^x6 and x4^x6 in Spin_8^+(q) construction.
