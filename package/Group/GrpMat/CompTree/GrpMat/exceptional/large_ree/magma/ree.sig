S,RecogniseLargeRee,"Constructively recognise G as a Large Ree group. If G is isomorphic to LargeRee(q) where q is the size of the defining field of G, then return: 1. Isomorphism from G to LargeRee(q). 2. Isomorphism from LargeRee(q) to G. 3. Map from G to the word group of G. 4. Map from the word group of G to G. The isomorphisms are composed of maps that are defined by rules, so Function can be used on each component. The word group is the GrpSLP which is the parent of the elements returned from LargeReeElementToWord. In general this is not the same as WordGroup(G), but is created from it using AddRedundantGenerators. If Verify is true, then it is checked that G really is isomorphic to LargeRee(q), otherwise this is not checked. In that case, the FieldSize must be set to the correct value of q",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,178,,36,175,175,175,175,-38
