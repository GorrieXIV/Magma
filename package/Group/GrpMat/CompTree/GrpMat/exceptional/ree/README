Ree group package for MAGMA
---------------------------

Provides constructive recognition and constructive membership routines for the
Ree groups Ree(q) = {^2}G_2(q), and its isomorphic copies. The main intrinsics
are RecogniseRee(G) which performs constructive recognition of G isomorphic 
to Ree(q), ReeElementToWord(G, g) which writes g as a straight
line program in the generators of G, and ReeRecognition(G) which is a 
non-constructive test for isomorphism between G and Sz(q).
  
Sylow subgroups can be found using the ReeSylow(G, p) intrinsic. For
finding conjugating elements between Sylow subgroups, an intrinsic 
ReeSylowConjugacy is provided. These should be the only necessary intrinsics.


At the top of tensor.mag, the paths should be changed to reflect your
situation.


To load the package, use AttachSpec on the included specification file called
"ree".
