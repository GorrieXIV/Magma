S,ReeSylow,"G is isomorphic to Ree(q), RecogniseRee(G) has returned true, p is a prime. Returns a random Sylow p-subgroup S of G. Also returns list of SLPs of the generators of S, in generators of G. If p does not divide |G|, then the trivial subgroup is returned",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,178,,178,82,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,ReeSylowConjugacy,"G is isomorphic to Ree(q), RecogniseRee(G) has returned true, p is a prime. R and S are Sylow p-subgroups of G. Returns g in G such that R^g = S. Also returns g as SLP in generators of G. Only implemented cases are p = 2,3 or p divides q - 1. If p does not divide |G|, then the identity element is returned",0,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,178,,0,0,178,,0,0,178,,180,137,-38,-38,-38,-38
