S,SuzukiSylow,"G is isomorphic to Sz(q), RecogniseSz(G) has returned true, p is a prime. Returns a random Sylow p-subgroup S of G. Also returns list of SLPs of the generators of S, in generators of G. If p does not divide |G|, then the trivial subgroup is returned",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,178,,178,82,-38,-38,-38,-38
