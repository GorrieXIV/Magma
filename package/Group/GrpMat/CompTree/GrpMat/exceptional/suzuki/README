Suzuki group package for MAGMA
------------------------------

Provides constructive recognition and constructive membership routines for the
Suzuki groups Sz(q), and its isomorphic copies. The main intrinsics
are RecogniseSz(G) which performs constructive recognition of G isomorphic 
to Sz(q), SzElementToWord(G, g) which writes g as a straight
line program in the generators of G, and SuzukiRecognition(G) which is a 
non-constructive test for isomorphism between G and Sz(q).
  
Sylow subgroups can be found using the SuzukiSylow(G, p) intrinsic. For
finding conjugating elements between Sylow subgroups, an intrinsic 
SuzukiSylowConjugacy is provided. These should be the only 
necessary intrinsics.

Presentations for Sz(q) can be handled via the intrinsics SzPresentation and
SatisfiesSzPresentation.


At the top of tensor.mag, the paths should be changed to reflect your
situation.


To load the package, use AttachSpec on the included specification file called
"suzuki".
