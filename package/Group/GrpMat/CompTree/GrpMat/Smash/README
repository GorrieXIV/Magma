The package providing access to functions which seek to
decide membership of Aschbacher categories (ii)-(iv) was 
prepared by E.A. O'Brien.  It combines, updates, and replaces 
material originally  developed  by  Holt, Leedham-Green, 
O'Brien, and Rees for categories (ii) and (iii).

Theoretical details of the algorithms used may be found in the 
following papers:

Subgroup'', J. Algebra 184, 818--838, 1996.
