S,CentraliserOfInvolution,"g is an involution in G, and wg is an SLP for g. Return the centraliser C of g in G, and SLPs of the generators of C. Randomiser is the random process used to construct the elements and the SLP for g must lie in the word group of this process. The algorithm used is that of John Bray. Since it is Monte Carlo, it may return only a subgroup of the centraliser. If Central then construct the projective centraliser of g. The function CompletionCheck is used to determine when we have constructed the centraliser. It takes arguments G, C, g and SLPs for generators of C as input, and returns true or false. By default, the algorithm completes when the centraliser has 20 generators or considered NumberRandom elements",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,137,,0,0,180,,0,0,178,,178,82,-38,-38,-38,-38
