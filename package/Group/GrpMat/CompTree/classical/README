MAGMA Classical groups package
------------------------------

Routines for constructive recognition and constructive membership testing of
classical groups in natural representation. At present, only fields of
odd characteristic are supported, except for linear groups.

Package put together by Henrik Bäärnhielm.


The main intrinsics are:

ClassicalConstructiveRecognition(GrpMat) -> BoolElt
ClassicalElementToWord(GrpMat, GrpMatElt) -> BoolElt, GrpSLPElt
