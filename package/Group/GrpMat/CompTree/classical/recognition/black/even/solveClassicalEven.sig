The output is a subgroup H of G which is isomorphic to SX(m,q) for some m<d. In the natural representation, H can be naturally embedded as a subgroup of block diagonal matrices with block sizes m and d-m; the base change matrix is attached as variable 'cob'. The type of H is the same as the type of G with the following exceptions: If q is even and G is symplectic, then H is of type OmegaPlus. If G is OmegaMinus, then H is of type OmegaPlus. The parameter type is of the form <SX,d,q> where SX is one of ""SL"", ""Sp"", ""SU"", ""O-"", ""O+""",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-27,,-27,148,-38,-38,-38,-38
