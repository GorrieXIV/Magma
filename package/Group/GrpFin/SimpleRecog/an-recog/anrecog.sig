V,AnRecog,5
S,RecogniseAlternatingOrSymmetric,"If G is isomorphic to the alternating or symmetric group of degree n >= 5, the function returns true, a homomorphism from G to Alt(n) or Sym(n), a homomorphism from Alt(n) or Sym(n) to G, a map from G to its word group, a map from the word group to G, and a boolean to indicate if G is either alternating or symmetric. Otherwise, the function returns false. The algorithm is that of Jambor, Leuner, Niemeyer, and Plesken [JLNP13], so there is a small probability (controlled by Epsilon) that it will return false incorrectly. If Extension is true, the function decides whether G/Z(G) is isomorphic to the alternating or symmetric group of degree n; now the second map is not a homomorphism, but induces a natural homomorphism from Alt(n) or Sym(n) to G/Z(G)",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-27,,36,175,175,175,175,36
