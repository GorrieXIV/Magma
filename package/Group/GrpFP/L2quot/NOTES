This directory contains two versions of the algorithm of Plesken and Fabianska
for computing the PSL(2,K) quotients of a two-generator finitely presented
group.

1) Michael Harrison's code (in L2quot.m) implements the intrinsic
HasInfinitePSL2Quotient [the fp-group must have only two generators]

2) Sebastian Jambor's code (in l2.m, l2subgroups.m and minass.m)
implements intrinsics L2Quotients, L2Type, L2Generatoirs, L2Ideals. These
give a detailed breakdown of all possible PSL2 quotients of the fp-group.
