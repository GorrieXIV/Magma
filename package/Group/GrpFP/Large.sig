S,IsLarge,"A finitely presented group G is large if it has a finite index subgroup that has a surjective homomorphism to a nonabelian free group. We attempt to decide if G is large by calculating the (multivariable) Alexander polynomial of those subgroups H of G having index h in [MinIndex..MaxIndex], and also subgroups of H having index up to 2*h in G. If the abelian torsion for a subgroup H is larger than MaxExponent, then we do not rewrite to obtain a presentation for H. If we prove that G is large, then return true and a subgroup which is a witness to this property. Otherwise we return false, but this implies only that we could not decide this property for G. If Simplify, then use Simplify as flag for rewriting of presentations for subgroups. If, in computing low index subgroups of a finite index subgroup H of G, the low-index subgroup calculation takes more than TimeLimit in seconds, then abort without trying to find more subgroups of H",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,148,,0,0,121,,36,121,-38,-38,-38,-38
