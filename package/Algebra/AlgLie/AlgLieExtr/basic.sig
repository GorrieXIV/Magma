S,MultiplicationTable,"Force computation of the multiplication table of L. Takes three optional parameters: Firstly, HowMuch (""Auto"", ""Top"" or ""Full""), designating how big a portion of the multiplication table should be computed. Second, MemLimit (integer, in MB) which stops the computation of the ""Full"" mult. table once that much memory has been allocated. Thirdly, FullJacobi (true or false) that decides whether once the appropriate part of the multiplication table has been computed, the Jacobi identity is tested in an attempt to reduce the rank of the coefficient ring.
