S,ThetaSeriesModularForm,"Returns the theta series of the integral lattice L as a modular form in the appropriate space (given by ThetaSeriesModularFormSpace). The theta series is normalized as follows (so that its level as a modular form is the most natural level): for even lattices, theta is the sum of e^(pi*i*Norm(v)) and for odd lattices it is the sum of e^(2*pi*i*Norm(v)). If some coefficients of the theta series of L or any of its partial duals are already known, this information may be passed in using the optional arguments KnownTheta (a power series) or KnownDualThetas (a sequence of power series). If it is known that L has modularities, these may be specified as KnownModularities (as set of integers). In addition, ComputeModularities (a boolean, or a set of integers) may be specified, to control whether the function should determine the modularities of L",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,164,,ModFrmElt,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
