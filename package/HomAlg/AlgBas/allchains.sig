S,LiftHomomorphismGroupP,"Creates the function from the projective module with L elements to the parent of the elements of the list L, such that the generators of the projective module go to the elements of L. Note that the algebra must be the basic algebra of a p-group",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,82,,155,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
