S,CompactProjectiveResolution,"Given a module M over a basic algebra and a natural number n the function computes a projective resolution for M out to n steps. The function returns the resolution in compact form together with the augmentation map (P_0 -> M). The compact form of the resolution is a list of the the minimal pieces of information needed to reconstruct the boundary maps in the resolution. That is, the boundary map (P_{i+1} -> P_i) is recorded as a tuple consisting of a matrix whose entries are the images of the generators for indecomposable projective modules making up P_{i+1} in the indecomposable projective modules making up P_i and two lists of integers givin the number of indecomposable projective modules of each isomorphism class in P_{i+1} and in P_i",0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,148,,0,0,25,,270,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
