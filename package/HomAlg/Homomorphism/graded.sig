S,BuildHomomorphismFromGradedCap,"Returns the graded homomorphism from the associated graded algebra X of A to the associated graded algebra Y of B, whose cap is phi. That is phi is the matrix of the induced homomorphism of X/Rad^2(X) to Y/Rad^2(Y)",0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,-1,,0,0,34,,0,0,34,,155,-38,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,GradedCoverAlgebra,This a assumes that we are given the truncated algebra of a graded algebra. It creates the basic algebra of the natural cover of A and also returns the matrix of the cover onto A,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,,34,155,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,GradedAutomorphismGroupMatchingIdempotents,"Returns the group of graded automorphisms of the basic algebra A that preserve the idempotents of A. Returns also the graded caps (matrices of homomorphisms from X/Rad^2(X) to itself, where X is the Associated Graded algebra of A) of the generators of the automorphism group in two sequenced, nonunipotent generators and unipotent generators",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,,178,82,82,-38,-38,-38
S,GradedAutomorphismGroup,"Returns the group of graded automorphisms of the associated graded algebra X of the basic algebra A. returns also the graded caps of the generators of the graded automorhism group. These are the induced automorphisms of X/Rad^2(X) to itself, and they are returned as two lists of nonunipotent and unipotent generators that preserve the idempotents of X and a list of generators that permute the idempotents",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,,178,82,82,82,224,-38
