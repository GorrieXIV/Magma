S,AutomorphismGroupMatchingIdempotents,"Returns the group of all automorphism of the basic algebra A that preserve the basic idempotent structure. That is, any element of this group induces the identity automorphism on the quotient A/Rad(A) of A by its Jacobson radical",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,,34,155,-38,-38,-38,-38
S,IsIsomorphicMatchingIdempotents,True if there is an isomorphism from the basic algebra A to the basic algebra B that preserves the ordering of the idempotents. The function also returns the matrix of the isomorphism,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,,0,0,34,,36,155,148,-38,-38,-38
S,AutomorphismGroupWithoutBlocks,"Returns the automorphism group of the basic Algebra A, together with the group of permutations of the idempotents that match automorphisms",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,34,,178,224,-38,-38,-38,-38
