S,AllRoots,"Find all roots to a polynomial equation. For a class of conjugate roots (with respect to the ground field) only one representative (in an appropriate extension) is returned. The first return value is a list '[* [* x, m *] ... *]' where 'x' is a root with multiplicity 'm'. If the ground field has to be extended, the algebraic elements will be displayed as 'ExtName_i' where 'i' starts from 'ExtCount'. The last return value is the value of 'ExtCount' plus the number of field extensions that have been introduced during the computation",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,312,,168,-45,-38,-38,-38,-38

S,SolveZeroDimIdeal,"Find the solutions of the (at most) zero-dimensional ideal 'I' of a multivariate polynomial ring.

S,SolveInProductSpace,"Given an ideal 'id' of a polynomial ring 'P' of rank 'n' and a sequence 'seq' s.t. the 'seq[i]' mark blocks of projective coordinates. Assuming that 'id' defines a zero-dimensional subset in the corresponding product space (with projective and affine components) returns a list of all (finitely many) points in the subset. For example, if 'n=6' and 'seq=[0,2,5]' then '[P.1 : P.2]' and '[P.3 : P.4 : P.5]' are the blocks of projective coordinates and 'P.6' is an affine coordinate. Then 'id' should be a two-dimensional ideal homogeneous w.r.t. total degrees for both blocks separately. It defines a point set in 'P^1 X P^2 X A^1'. If no projective coordinates are intended use 'seq=[0]'. If the ground field has to be extended, the algebraic elements will be displayed as 'ExtName_i' where 'i' starts from 'ExtCount'. The last return value is the value of 'ExtCount' plus the number of field extensions that have been introduced during the computation",0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,64,,168,148,-38,-38,-38,-38
