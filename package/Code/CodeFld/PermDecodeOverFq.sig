S,IsPermutationDecodeSet,"Given an [n,k] linear code C over a finite field K; a sequence I in [1,...,n];  a sequence S of elements in the group of monomial matrices of order n over K;  and an integer s in [1,...,t], where t is the error-correcting capability of C,  return true if and only if S is an s-PD-set for C with respect to the information  set I.
