			**************************
			* INSTALLATION PROCEDURE *
			**************************


Here we give the Magma installation procedure which assumes the files
are in the gzip-compressed format.  The utility 'gunzip' should be in
your path (usually it is in /usr/local/bin).  We suppose that all the
Magma files are to be installed in the directory /usr/local/magma and
that the Magma driving script "magma" is to be installed as
/usr/local/bin/magma; change these to whatever is appropriate in the
following.

(0)	For all versions other than Windows versions, you must have
	a password file 'magmapassfile'.  First mail to us at
	magma@maths.usyd.edu.au the following information for each
	machine covered by your licence:

	    Linux (32/64-bit)	MAC address (see http://tinyurl.com/8nkm3)
	    Intel Mac (OSX)	MAC address (see http://tinyurl.com/8nkm3)
	    Windows (32/64-bit)	MAC address (see http://tinyurl.com/8nkm3)
	    Compaq/Dec Alpha	Internet address
	    HP			ID number (Use 'uname -i' command)
	    IBM RS/6000		ID number (Use 'uname -m' command)
	    SGI			Hostid (Use 'hostid' command)
	    Sun Sparc		Hostid (Use 'hostid' command)

	We will then mail you a string of digits.  Create the text file
	'magmapassfile' and copy the string of digits into the file
	(there should be no blank lines before or after the digits in the
	file).  Make sure that the file is readable by all by typing
	the command:

		chmod a+r magmapassfile

	Place the file in the directory in which you have downloaded
	the other Magma files.  This is all that needs be done for this
	file: the 'magma' script mentioned below should point to it at
	the end of the installation.

(1)	Make the directory /usr/local/magma, move all the Magma files into
	/usr/local/magma, and then change directory there by typing:

		cd /usr/local/magma

(2)	Unpack the executable and fix its permissions by one of the following:

	(a) For the Alpha version, first type

		gunzip magma.exe
		chmod 755 magma.exe

	    then if this magma.exe does not work when you have set up the
	    'magma' script below, type:

		mv magma.exe magma.exe.dyn
		gunzip <magma.static.exe.gz >magma.exe
		chmod 755 magma.exe

	    and this statically-linked executable should work -- mail us
	    if it doesn't.

	(b) For Linux versions, first type

		gunzip magma.exe
		chmod 755 magma.exe

	    then if this magma.exe does not work when you have set up the
	    'magma' script below, type:

		mv magma.exe magma.static.exe
		gunzip <magma.dynamic.exe >magma.exe
		chmod 755 magma.exe

	    and this dynamically-linked executable should work -- mail us
	    if it doesn't.

	    If your machine has a Pentium 4, you should download the
	    Pentium-4 compiled version magma.exe.p4.gz and rename this
	    to magma.exe after it is uncompressed, and use this instead
	    of the default version, since it should be faster.

	(c) For all other versions, type:

		gunzip magma.exe
		chmod 755 magma.exe

	(d) Since V2.17, if this is the Macintosh 64-bit Intel version,
	    also make sure that the file:

	    	libgmp.3.dylib

	    is also present in the same directory as magma.exe;
	    if not, download it from:

		https://magma.maths.usyd.edu.au/magma/export/mac-x86_64-osx

	    and place it there.

(3)	If you downloaded the shared_complete.tar.gz file, unpack it by:

		gunzip < shared_complete.tar.gz | tar xopf -

	(The 'o' flag to tar ensures that the files will be unpacked with
	root ownership if you are running as root.  If your machine does
	not allow the 'o' flag, just omit it, or choose something else
	appropriate.  The 'p' flag ensures that the correct permissions
	are extracted from these files.)

(4)	Otherwise, you will need to unpack the individual .tar.gz files
	mentioned above:

		gunzip < InternalHelp.tar.gz | tar xopf -
		gunzip < ThirdParty.tar.gz | tar xopf -
		gunzip < doc.tar.gz | tar xopf -
		gunzip < libs.tar.gz | tar xopf -
		gunzip < package.tar.gz | tar xopf -

	(The 'o' flag to tar ensures that the files will be unpacked with
	root ownership if you are running as root.  If your machine does
	not allow the 'o' flag, just omit it, or choose something else
	appropriate.  The 'p' flag ensures that the correct permissions
	are extracted from these files.)

(5)	Edit the magma script and change the ..... to /usr/local/magma
	(or wherever you are installing Magma) so that all files and
	directories in the script are referred to correctly.

	Ensure that it is executable:

	    chmod 755 magma

	IMPORTANT: The various extracted files should have the correct
	permissions, but sometimes these can be lost.  All the files
	need to be readable by everyone who will be using Magma.  One
	way to ensure this is to run the following two commands in the
	Magma installation directory:

	    find . -type d -exec chmod go+rx '{}' ';'
	    find . -type f -exec chmod go+r '{}' ';'

(6)	Put a link from /usr/local/bin/magma to /usr/local/magma/magma by:

		ln -s /usr/local/magma/magma /usr/local/bin/magma

(7)	Try running magma by:

		magma

	(perhaps type "rehash" first if you use csh).  You can test the
	Help system by typing ? at the Magma prompt.  The Magma system
	packages should be automatically loaded also (you will not
	see any complaint if this is so).  If you get some error
	messages to do with packages, check that package.tar.gz was
	unpacked correctly and that the environment variable
	MAGMA_SYSTEM_SPEC is set correctly to the file "spec" in the
	root of the package directory.





			*********************
			* FILES DESCRIPTION *
			*********************


A short description of each of the (uncompressed) files follows.


INSTALL.txt
-----------

This file.


README.txt
----------

A file similar to this one describing the files but intended for the
users, not the system manager.


ThirdParty.tar
--------------

Information about and licenses for the third party libraries used by
Magma.


doc.tar
-------

A tar file which contains the directory "doc" which contains the Magma
documentation (details below).  See the README.txt file in that
directory for more information.


magmapassfile
-------------

The password file which tells Magma what are the valid hosts on which
Magma can be run for your licence.  If you wish to add more hosts
within your licence, or change the hosts on which you wish to run
Magma, all you need do is contact us with the list of hostids for the
appropriate machines.  We can then create a new password file for the
new list and send it to you -- nothing else in the distribution need be
changed.


magma, magma.exe
----------------

Magma consists of the binary executable "magma.exe" and a driving shell
script "magma" which sets some environment variables first so the
executable "magma.exe" can find the password file "magmapassfile",
etc.

For the Alpha version of Magma, there are two versions of the Magma
executable included.  The file magma.exe is a dynamically linked
version and the file magma.static.exe is a statically linked version.
First use the dynamically-linked version magma.exe and see if that that
works on your Alpha (details below in installation instructions).  If
this executable doesn't work (probably if your version of OSF is before
V3.0), try copying magma.static.exe to magma.exe (save magma.exe first)
and see if that works (again, details below).  If that still doesn't
work, please contact us.

For the Sun versions, the file magma.exe is always a native Solaris 2
executable (use it for machines running Solaris 2), while the file
magma.exe.sunos4 is a SunOS 4.1 executable -- use it for machines
running SunOS 4.1 (i.e., copy it to the filename magma.exe on such
machines).

For the Linux version, the executable magma.exe is statically linked.
If this executable doesn't work (probably because your version of Linux
is newer than ours), try using the dynamically linked executable
magma.exe.dyn if it is present; otherwise please contact us and we'll
send you the dynamically linked executable.

The shell script "magma" simply sets the environment variable
MAGMAPASSFILE so that the executable "magma.exe" can find the password
file.  Other environment variables are also set.  The first line of
the script runs:

	ROOT=.....

To install the Magma executable, change the ..... to the root directory
in which the executable magma.exe is installed.

Make sure the executable file magma.exe is publically executable by all
users of Magma.  Furthermore, if your operating system is Solaris, the
file magma.exe should be publically *readable* by all (this is needed so
that timing in Magma works).  Type the command

	chmod 755 magma.exe

to ensure this.


package.tar
-----------

A tar file which contains the directory "package" which has the Magma
system packages used by Magma internally.  It should be installed in a
publically-readable place and the environment variable
MAGMA_SYSTEM_SPEC should be set to the file "spec" in its root.


InternalHelp.tar
----------------

A tar file which contains the directory "InternalHelp" which has all
the data files used by the Magma Help System.  It should be installed
in a publically-readable place.


libs.tar
--------

libs.tar is a tar file which consists of a collection of libraries
for use with Magma.  When un-tarred, there is a directory 'libs' which
contains each library in a subdirectory and two shell scripts PATH.sh
and PATH.csh to set the environment variables MAGMA_LIBRARY_ROOT and
MAGMA_LIBRARIES to access the libraries.

There are other databases not included in the libs tar by default;
these may be downloaded from the 'Optional Databases' section of the
Downloads area of the Magma website.

			************************
			* USE OF FREE SOFTWARE *
			************************

		Third party libraries used by Magma

Depending on architecture, one or more of the following third party
libraries may be used by Magma, in accordance with any appropriate
licenses.

  * ATLAS	http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
  * GMP		http://www.swox.com/gmp/
  * GMP-ECM	http://www.komite.net/laurent/soft/ecm/ecm-6.0.1.html
  * MPC		http://www.lix.polytechnique.fr/Labo/Andreas.Enge/Mpc.html
  * MPFR	http://www.mpfr.org/

In each case the appropriate license is reproduced in the ThirdParty
subdirectory of the Magma installation directory.

Some of the above libraries use the GNU LGPL license.  To comply with
this license (point 6) we will provide to licensed Magma users on request
a shared-library version of Magma which will be linkable against future
versions of these libraries.  Please note that this is quite unnecessary
for current licensed Magma users, since all versions of Magma which use
these libraries will always be kept up to date with the latest applicable
versions; this offer is made simply to comply with the GNU LGPL license.
