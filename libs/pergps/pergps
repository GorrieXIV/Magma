"   This database contains a number of permutation representations
for finite groups. A particular group is included either if

   (a) It is an 'interesting' group. In practice this means a
simple group or a close relative of a simple group; or

   (b) It is representative of some class of groups which is
useful for testing conjectures and algorithms.

   A considerable number of permutation groups are immediately
available to the Magma user through the use of standard functions.

For a list of the groups in this database and further information on
how to construct other permutation groups, type:
