This libs directory contains various libraries and databases for Magma.

galpols		This database contains for each transitive group G with degree
		between 2 and 15, a univariate polynomial over the integers
		which has G as its Galois group.

isolgps		A database of irreducible soluble subgroups of GL(n, p) 
		for n > 1 and p^n < 256.

matgps		This database contains various useful matrix groups, 
		almost all over finite fields (the only exception is 
		the Weyl group E6).

pergps		This database contains a number of permutation representations
		for finite groups. A particular group is included either if
		(a) It is an 'interesting' group. In practice this means a
		simple group or a close relative of a simple group; or
		(b) It is representative of some class of groups which is
		useful for testing conjectures and algorithms.

simgps		This database contains presentations for all simple groups  of
		order less than a million. The database was prepared by Jamali,
		Robertson and Campbell.

solgps		This database contains pc-presentations of 13 soluble groups
		constructed by S.P. Glasby.

For further information about any of these databases while in Magma, type

?DATABASENAME

where DATABASENAME is one of the database names above.


The directory also contains:

data		This is a directory containing various data files used by
		Magma internally.  It should be left in the top of the
		libs directory.
