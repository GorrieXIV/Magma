This library contains, for each transitive group G with degree between
2 and 15, a univariate polynomial over the integers which has G as its
Galois group.

The polynomials are accessed by the following function.

PolynomialWithGaloisGroup(d, n)
Returns a polynomial p whose Galois group is the n-th transitive
group of degree d, where the numbering is that of Butler and
McKay.
