Magma Test Suite
================

To run all standard tests in this directory, type something like:

	./test_all magma >test.out 2>&1

which will place the output in the file 'test.out'.  'magma' should be
the name by which Magma is executed.

To test that the tests run successfully, then type:

	grep -i error test.out

If the grep command gives no output then all is fine.  The tests
are designed so that the word 'error' or 'Error' is printed iff
there is an error somewhere.
