    This database contains various useful matrix groups, almost all over finite
fields (the only exception is the Weyl group E6).  Other standard matrix groups
can be constructed directly in Magma.  These are:
	GL(n, q)	GL(n, GF(q))
	SL(n, q)	SL(n, GF(q))
	Sp(n, q)	Sp(n, GF(q))
	GU(n, q)	GU(n, GF(q))
	SU(n, q)	SU(n, GF(q))
	Sz(q)		Sz(GF(q))

The following is a list of the groups in this database:

co1f2		The first Conway group.
		Matrices of degree 24 over GF(2).
