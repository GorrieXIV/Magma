		Third party libraries used by Magma

Depending on architecture, one or more of the following third party
libraries may be used by Magma, in accordance with any appropriate
licenses.

  * ATLAS	http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/
  * GMP		http://gmplib.org/
  * GMP-ECM	http://ecm.gforge.inria.fr/
  * MPC		http://www.multiprecision.org/
  * MPFR	http://www.mpfr.org/

In each case the appropriate license is reproduced in the ThirdParty
subdirectory of the Magma installation directory.

Some of the above libraries use the GNU LGPL license.  To comply with
this license (point 6) we will provide to licensed Magma users on request
a shared-library version of Magma which will be linkable against future
versions of these libraries.  Please note that this is quite unnecessary
for current licensed Magma users, since all versions of Magma which use
these libraries will always be kept up to date with the latest applicable
versions; this offer is made simply to comply with the GNU LGPL license.
