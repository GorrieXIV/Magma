In 1905, in the course of proving the independence of the field postulates,
L. E. Dickson <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_dickson-1905a">[Dic05a]</A> (p. 203) introduced the first example of a
nearfield.  His example is a set of 9 elements with
operations of addition and multiplication which satisfy all the axioms of a
field except for the commutative law of multiplication and the right
distributive law. Later that year Dickson <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_dickson-1905b">[Dic05b]</A> published a
more extensive collection of examples: an infinite series obtained by twisting
the multiplication of a Galois field and seven "irregular" examples.
<P>
The terminology `nearfield' seems to have introduced by Zassenhaus in his 1935
paper <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_zassenhaus-1935b">[Zas35]</A> where he showed that the only finite nearfields
(endliche Fastk&ouml;rper) are those due to Dickson.
<P>
The irregular nearfields are often referred to as Zassenhaus nearfields and the
nearfields in the infinite series are called Dickson nearfields.
<P>
In the papers of Dickson and Zassenhaus the nearfields are left-distributive
but for the purposes of the Magma implementation we consider only
right-distributive nearfields.

Nearfields are important in group theory, geometry and a combination of
these two fields. On the one
hand, the finite sharply doubly transitive permutation groups are in
one-to-one correspondence with the finite nearfields and on the other hand,
nearfields coordinatise a class of translation planes
<A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_hall-1959">[Hal59]</A>, <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_luneburg-1968">[L"69]</A> and they are the starting point for the
construction of the Hughes planes <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_dembowski-1971">[Dem71]</A>, <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_hughes-1957">[Hug57]</A>.
Furthermore, every sharply transitive
collineation group of projective space over a finite field is a quotient
of the group of units of a nearfield <A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_ellers-karzel-1963">[EK63]</A> (see also,
<A  HREF = "text197.htm#bib_dembowski-1968">[Dem68, S1.4, n()<sup>scriptstyle o</sup> 17]</A>).
