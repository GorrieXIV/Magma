In this chapter we describe techniques for computing with 
<I>*-algebras</I>, namely algebras equipped with 
an anti-automorphism x |-&gt; x<sup> * </sup> of order at most 2
(an <I>involution</I> or <I>star</I>). 
For further information on involutions and the structure
of *-algebras see <A  HREF = "text999.htm#bib_Albert">[Alb61]</A> and <A  HREF = "text999.htm#bib_Involutions">[KMRT98]</A>.
<P>
The principal application of these techniques is currently 
to isometry groups of systems of reflexive forms (and the 
intimately related study of intersections of classical groups). 
However, it is also possible to use the techniques to compute 
with group algebras of moderate dimension.
<P>
To any set of reflexive forms defined on a common vector 
space (a <I>system of forms</I>) one may associate a matrix 
*-algebra called the <I>adjoint algebra</I> of the system. 
The group of units of this adjoint algebra contains a natural 
subgroup of <I>unitary elements</I>, namely those elements x 
satisfying the condition x<sup> * </sup>=x<sup> - 1</sup>. The group of unitary 
elements coincides with 
the group of isometries of the system of forms, which 
is also the intersection of the general classical groups 
associated with these forms.
<P>
The StarAlgebras package provides functions that enable 
the user to investigate the structure of 
*-algebras. It also provides functions to compute and 
determine the structure of the group of isometries of a 
system of reflexive forms, and to compute intersections
of arbitrary collections of classical groups defined on a 
common vector space.
<P>
The algorithms are mainly due to Peter Brooksbank and
James Wilson <A  HREF = "text999.htm#bib_BrooksbankWilson1">[BW11a]</A>, <A  HREF = "text999.htm#bib_BrooksbankWilson2">[BW11b]</A>.
