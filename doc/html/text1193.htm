This chapter gives functionality for direct sums of <I>highest weight 
representations</I> (or modules).
This is an important class of representations of (almost) semisimple Lie
algebras (Chapter <A  HREF = "text1130.htm#12659">LIE ALGEBRAS</A>) and connected reductive algebraic groups
(Chapter <A  HREF = "text1175.htm#13090">GROUPS OF LIE TYPE</A>). 
This class includes all finite dimensional representations if the base field is
the complex field.
<P>
The representations we are considering are in bijection with sets of dominant
weights with multiplicities.  
Such sets are called <I>decomposition multisets</I>.
Many interesting computations in representation theory can be done
combinatorially with weight multisets, without the need to construct
the module itself.  
Examples of the things we can compute include:
module dimension,  the multiset of all the weights, and
decomposition multisets for symmetric powers, alternating powers, and tensor
products.
We can also restrict a decomposition multiset to a subgroup or induce it to a
supergroup. 
<P>
The code for such combinatorial computations is based on the LiE software 
package <A  HREF = "text1191.htm#bib_leeuwen-cohen-lisser">[vLCL92]</A>.
The algorithms for computing the actual representations are from
<A  HREF = "text1191.htm#bib_wdg-lie-hwrep">[dG01]</A> in the Lie algebra case, and from <A  HREF = "text1191.htm#bib_CohenMurrayTaylor">[CMT04]</A>
in the group case.

This introduction is inspired by the LiE manual 
<A  HREF = "text1191.htm#bib_leeuwen-cohen-lisser">[vLCL92]</A>.

First consider connected reductive Lie groups over the complex field. 
If G is a connected reductive complex Lie group, then it is a homomorphic 
image G=&xi;(G'), where &xi; is a Lie-group
homomorphism with finite kernel and G' is the direct product of a simply
connected group and a torus.
Recall that a simply connected group is a direct product of <I>simple</I>
simply connected groups.
In particular, such groups are determined by their Cartan name and the
dimension of the torus.
For example, we denote the direct product of the group of type 
A<sub>4</sub> C<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub> with a two dimensional torus by  A<sub>4</sub> C<sub>3</sub> B<sub>2</sub> T<sub>2</sub>.
Most of the code ported from LiE works only for groups of this form.
Similar terminology is used for the root datum corresponding to a group.
<P>
<P>
Connected reductive complex Lie groups have a very pleasing representation
theory: 
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>-- </DT><DD>Every module decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible
representations. 
<DT>-- </DT><DD>The (finite dimensional) irreducible representations correspond to
dominant weights.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
It follows that representations correspond to finite sets of dominant weights 
with multiplicity. 
These multisets are called <I>decomposition multisets</I>.
We can use this classification to do useful computations about representations,
without having to explicitly construct them.
<P>
<P>
Multisets of weights can be used for other purposes as well:
The multiset of all weights occurring in a module M is called the
<I>character multiset</I>.
Since the Weyl group permutes the weights
occurring in the character of M, it suffices to
consider only the dominant weights with their multiplicities.
This is called the <I>dominant character multiset</I>.
In the LiE system,  multisets of weights are represented by polynomials: for
example, the decomposition multiset is called a decomposition character.
<P>
When using the functions in this section, it is important to keep track of 
which kind of multiset you are using.  
For example, if you input a decomposition multiset to a function that expects a
dominant character multiset, the output is meaningless.  
<P>
<P>
We often abbreviate decomposition multiset to <I>decomposition</I>, and similarly for character multisets. 
Write R<sub>D</sub> for the root datum of the group of the
decomposition D. 
Denote the irreducible module for the group with root datum R with highest
weight v by V<sup>R</sup><sub>v</sub>, or to V<sub>v</sub> if R is clear from the context. 
<P>
It is often useful to define consider <I>virtual</I> multisets, 
which allow weights to have negative multiplicities.
We call a virtual multiset <I>proper</I> if its weights all have nonnegative 
multiplicities. 
A decomposition corresponds to an actual module if and only if it is proper.

Many functions use a special syntax for finite-order elements of the 
torus of a Lie group G (we are rarely interested in infinite-order
elements). Recall that a weight is in fact a mapping from the torus T to
C<sup>star</sup>, and thus a weight &lambda; can be evaluated at an element t &isin;T.
The resulting element is written t<sup>&lambda;</sup>. A set of fundamental weights
&omega;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &omega;<sub>r</sub> has the property that any element t &isin;T is
uniquely determined by the values t<sup>&omega;<sub>1</sub></sup>, ..., t<sup>&omega;<sub>r</sub></sup>.
Therefore, we may represent t as a vector (a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>r</sub>, n), with the
property that t<sup>&omega;<sub>i</sub></sup> = e<sup>2 &pi; i a<sub>i</sub> / n</sup> = &zeta;<sub>n</sub><sup>a<sub>i</sub></sup>, where
&zeta;<sub>n</sub> = e<sup>2 &pi; i / n</sup> is the canonical n-th root of unity. 
An example of a function which uses this syntax for toral elements 
is <A  HREF = "text1196.htm#spectrumRvt">Spectrum</A>. 
This function also provides a means to convert toral elements into a more 
natural form: see Example <A  HREF = "text1196.htm#13367">H110E10</A>.


<H4><A NAME = "13294">Other Highest Weight  Representations</A></H4>

Magma can also construct highest weight representations for:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>-- </DT><DD>(Almost) reductive Lie algebras (Chapter <A  HREF = "text1130.htm#12659">LIE ALGEBRAS</A>); and
<DT>-- </DT><DD>Split groups of Lie type (Chapter <A  HREF = "text1175.htm#13090">GROUPS OF LIE TYPE</A>).
<P>
</DL>
If the base field ha positive characteristic, highest weight representations are
indecomposable, but not necessarily irreducible. 
In some cases there are irreducible representations which are not highest
weight representations. 
<P>
For groups of Lie type, we consider projective representations (i.e.,
homomorphisms to a projective general linear group).
Suppose G is a split group of Lie type defined over 
the field k and r is the least common multiple of the nonzero abelian-group
invariants of the coisogeny group of G (see Section <A  HREF = "text1090.htm#12122">Isogeny of Split Reduced Root  Data</A>).
Let K be an extension of k containing at least one rth root of each element of k (i.e., K contains a Kummer extension).  
Then highest weight representations are projective representations defined over K, and are constructed using polynomial functions and rth roots.
<P>
If k already contains all rth roots, then no extension is needed and the 
representation will be linear rather than projective.  This happens when r=1,
i.e., the coisogeny group is torsion free.
This includes direct products of a simply connected group and a torus.
The general linear group also has this property.
It also happens when k is the complex field or field of algebraic numbers,
when k is the real field and r is odd, and when k is finite and
|k| - 1 is coprime to r.
<P>
The functions give a warning when the representation is not linear, but this can be avoided using the optional parameter <TT>NoWarning</TT>.
Note that an appropriate extension K can be constructed for all fields other 
than rational function fields, fields of Laurent series, and local fields.  
In these cases, as well as for nonfields, the representations can only be 
computed when r=1.
