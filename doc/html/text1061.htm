A (real) reflection is an automorphism of a real vector space that acts as
negation on a one-dimensional subspace while fixing a hyperplane pointwise.
The subspace is described by a vector called the <I>root</I>, 
while the hyperplane is described as the kernel
of an element of the dual space called the <I>coroot</I>.  
<P>
A root system is a collection of root/coroot pairs that
is closed under the action of the corresponding reflections.  
Only finite root systems are supported at the present time.  
A root system gives a much more detailed description of a reflection
representation of a finite Coxeter group.
<P>
Root systems are used to classify the <I>semisimple Lie algebras</I>.
The closely related concept of a root datum is used to classify the
<I>groups of Lie type</I>.
<P>
This is described in Chapters <A  HREF = "text1079.htm#12000">ROOT SYSTEMS</A> and <A  HREF = "text1089.htm#12115">ROOT DATA</A>.
