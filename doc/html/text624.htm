In the following description, G is a group in the category <A  HREF = "text630.htm#GrpPerm"> <TT>GrpPerm</TT></A>,
p is a prime number, and K is the finite field of order p. Further,
F is a finitely presented group having the same number of generators as G,
and is such that its relations are satisfied by the corresponding generators of
G. In other words, the mapping taking the i-th generator of F to the
i-th generator of G must be an epimorphism. Usually this mapping will be an
isomorphism, although this is not mandatory.

Assume that F is isomorphic to the permutation group G, and that 
we wish to determine presentations for one or more extensions of the 
K-module M by F, where K is the field of p elements.
We first create an extension process using 
<TT>ExtensionProcess(G, M, F)</TT>. The possible extensions of M by G
are in one-one correspondence with the elements of the second cohomology 
group H<sup>2</sup>(G, M) of G acting on M. Let b<sub>1</sub>, ..., b<sub>l</sub> be a basis
of H<sup>2</sup>(G, M). A general element of H<sup>2</sup>(G, M) therefore has the form 
a<sub>1</sub>b<sub>1</sub> + ... + a<sub>l</sub>b<sub>l</sub> and so can be defined by a sequence Q of 
l integers [a<sub>1</sub>, ..., a<sub>l</sub>]. Now, to construct the corresponding 
extension of M by G we call the function <TT>Extension(P, Q)</TT>. 
The required extension is returned as a finitely presented group. If all the
extensions are required then they may be obtained successively by 
making p<sup>l</sup> calls to the function <TT>NextExtension</TT>. 
<H5><A NAME = "6852">SplitExtension(G, M, F) : GrpPerm, ModRng, GrpFP -&gt; GrpFP</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The split extension of the module M by the group G.
