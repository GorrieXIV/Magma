<P>

When starting up Magma, various command-line options can be supplied,
and a list of files to be automatically loaded can also be specified.  
These files may be specified by simply listing their names as normal 
arguments (i.e., without a <TT>-</TT> option) following the Magma command.  
For each such file name, a search for the specified file is conducted,
starting in the current directory, and in directories specified by the
environment variable <TT>MAGMA_PATH</TT> after that if necessary.
It is also possible to have a <I>startup file</I>, in which one would usually
store personal settings of parameters and variables.  The startup file is
specified by the <TT>MAGMA_STARTUP_FILE</TT> environment variable which
should be set in the user's <TT>.cshrc</TT> file or similar.  This environment
variable can be overridden by the <TT>-s</TT> option, or cancelled by
the <TT>-n</TT> option.
The files specified by the arguments to Magma are loaded <I>after</I> the
startup file.  Thus the startup file is not cancelled by giving extra file
arguments, which is what is usually desired.
<P>
<P>
Magma also allows one to set variables from the command line --- if one
of the arguments is of the form <I>var</I><TT>:=</TT><I>val</I>, where <I>var</I> is
a valid identifier (consisting of letters, underscores, or non-initial digits)
and there is no space between <I>var</I> and the <TT>:=</TT>, then the variable
<I>var</I> is assigned within Magma to the <I>string</I> value <I>val</I>
at the point where that argument is processed.  (Functions like
<TT>StringToInteger</TT> should be used to convert the value to an object of
another type once inside Magma.)


<H5><A NAME = "370">magma -b</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-b</TT> argument is given to Magma, the opening banner and
all other introductory messages are suppressed.  The final "total
time" message is also suppressed.  This is useful when sending the
whole output of a Magma process to a file so that extra removing
of unwanted output is not needed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "371">magma -c filename</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-c</TT> argument is given to Magma, followed by a filename,
the filename is assumed to refer to a package source file and the
package is compiled and Magma then exits straight away.  This option
is rarely needed since packages are automatically compiled when attached.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "372">magma -d</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-d</TT> option is supplied to Magma, the licence for the current
<TT>magmapassfile</TT> is dumped.  That is, the expiry date and the valid
hostids are displayed.  Magma then exits.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "373">magma -n</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-n</TT> option is supplied to Magma, any startup file specified by
the environment variable <TT>MAGMA_STARTUP_FILE</TT> or by the <TT>-s</TT>
option is cancelled.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "374">magma -q name</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-q</TT> option is supplied to Magma, then Magma operates
in a special manner as a slave (with the given name) for the
<A  HREF = "text165.htm#RngInt:MPQS">MPQS</A> integer factorisation algorithm.  Please see that
function for more details.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "375">magma -r workspace</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-r</TT> option is supplied to Magma, together with a workspace
file, that workspace is automatically restored by Magma when it starts
up.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "376">magma -s filename</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If the <TT>-s</TT> option is supplied to Magma, the given filename
is used for the startup file for Magma.  This overrides the
variable of the environment variable <TT>MAGMA_STARTUP_FILE</TT> if
it has been set.  This option should not be used (as it was before),
for automatically loading files since that can be done by just listing
them as arguments to the Magma process.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "377">magma -S integer</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When starting up Magma, it is possible to specify a seed for the 
generation of pseudo-random numbers. (Pseudo-random quantities are
used in several Magma algorithms, and may also be generated 
explicitly by some intrinsics.)  The seed should be in the range
0 to (2 ^ (32) - 1) inclusive.  If <TT>-S</TT> is not followed by any
number, or if the <TT>-S</TT> option is not used, Magma selects the seed
itself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME = "378">Example <TT>Env_Startup (H4E1)</TT></A></H3>
By typing the command
<P>
    <TT>magma file1 x:=abc file2</TT>
<P>
Magma would start up, read the user's startup file specified by
<TT>MAGMA_STARTUP_FILE</TT> if existent, then read the file <TT>file1</TT>, then
assign the variable <TT>x</TT> to the string value <TT>"abc"</TT>, then read
the file <TT>file2</TT>, then give the prompt.
