An assignment is an association of an identifier to a <I>value</I>.
The statement,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; a := 6;
</PRE>
establishes an association between the identifier a and the value 6 (6 is 
said to be <I>the value of a</I>, or to be <I>assigned to a</I>). A collection of 
such assignments is called a <I>context</I>.
<P>
When a value V is assigned to an identifier I one of two things happens:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(1)</DT><DD>if I has not been previously assigned to, it is added to the current context
and associated with V. I is said to be <I>declared</I> when it is assigned to for
the first time.
<DT>(2)</DT><DD>if I has been previously assigned to, the value associated with I is changed
to V. I is said to be <I>re-assigned</I>. 
<P>
<P>
</DL>
The ability to assign and re-assign to identifiers is why Magma  is called
an <I>imperative</I> language.
<P>
One very important point about assignment is illustrated by the following
example. Say we type,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; a := 6;
&gt; b := a+7;
</PRE>
After executing these two lines the context is <TT>[ (a,6), (b,13) ]</TT>.
Now say we type,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; a := 0;
</PRE>
The context is now <TT>[ (a,0), (b,13) ]</TT>. Note that changing the value of a 
does <I>not</I> change the value of b because b's value is statically determined 
at the point where it is assigned. Changing a does <I>not</I> produce the context 
<TT>[ (a,0), (b,7) ]</TT>.
