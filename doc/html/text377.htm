Cyclotomic Fields (like the Quadratic Fields) are a subtype of the Number 
Fields (<TT>FldNum</TT>). They have some extra functionality which is described 
below and use some more efficient implementations. Orders of cyclotomic fields 
form the category <A NAME = "RngCyc"><TT>RngCyc</TT></A> and the fields themselves <A NAME = "FldCyc"><TT>FldCyc</TT></A>.
Functions for cyclotomic fields and orders which work generally for number
fields, their orders and elements are listed in Chapter <A  HREF = "text356.htm#3368">NUMBER FIELDS</A>.
<P>
There are two different representations of cyclotomic fields available:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>*</DT><DD>The "dense" representation: the field is conceptually represented as
  Q(x)/f(x) where f is a cyclotomic polynomial, i.e., the minimal 
  polynomial of a primitive root of unity.
<P>
<DT>*</DT><DD>The "sparse" representation: Let n=&prod;p<sub>i</sub><sup>r<sub>i</sub></sup> be the factorisation
  of n into prime powers and n<sub>i</sub> := p<sub>i</sub><sup>r<sub>i</sub></sup>. 
  Then Q(&zeta;<sub>n</sub>) = Q(&zeta;<sub>n<sub>1</sub></sub>, ..., &zeta;<sub>n<sub>r</sub></sub>) and the field
  is represented as 
  Q(x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>r</sub>)/&lt; f<sub>n<sub>1</sub></sub>(x<sub>1</sub>), ..., f<sub>n<sub>r</sub></sub>(x<sub>r</sub>) &gt;.
<P>
</DL>
As with the number fields, the non-simple representation, the issues are the 
same: the "sparse" representation allows for much larger fields -- as long
as the elements used have only few coefficients. The "dense" representation
on the other hand has the asymptotically-fastest arithmetic.
