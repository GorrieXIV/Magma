Quadratic fields in Magma can be created as a subtype of the number fields
<TT>FldNum</TT>.
The advantage of the special quadratic fields is that some special
(faster) algorithms have been or will be implemented to deal with them;
the functions for the special quadratic fields (created with the
<A  HREF = "text371.htm#FldQuad:QuadraticField">QuadraticField</A>
function) are described here. Functions which work 
generally for number fields and their orders are described in 
Chapter <A  HREF = "text356.htm#3368">NUMBER FIELDS</A>.
<P>
The categories involved are <A NAME = "FldQuad"><TT>FldQuad</TT></A> for fields, 
<A NAME = "RngQuad"><TT>RngQuad</TT></A> for their orders and 
<A NAME = "FldQuadElt"><TT>FldQuadElt</TT></A> and <A NAME = "RngQuadElt"><TT>RngQuadElt</TT></A> 
for their elements.

For every squarefree integer d (not 0 or 1) there is a unique quadratic
field Q(Sqrt(d)); for any integer k we have the field 
Q(Sqrt(k<sup>2</sup>d)) isomorphic to Q(Sqrt(d)). 
Given any integer m, the function 
<A  HREF = "text371.htm#FldQuad:QuadraticField">QuadraticField</A>
will create a structure corresponding to the quadratic field Q(Sqrt(d)),
where d is the squarefree kernel of m (d will have the same sign as m
and its absolute value is the largest squarefree divisor of m).
In Magma a list of quadratic fields currently present is
maintained, and if Q(Sqrt(d)) has been created before a reference on
it will be returned: two fields with the same d are the same.
The discriminant D of Q(Sqrt(d)) will be D=d if d &equiv; 1bmod4 and
D=4d if d equiv2, 3bmod4.
<P>
Elements of Q(Sqrt(d)) are represented by a common positive denominator b
and two integer coefficients: &alpha;=(1/b)(x + ySqrt(d)).
<P>
The ring of integers of F=Q(Sqrt(d)) will be O<sub>F</sub>=Z + &epsilon;<sub>d</sub>Z, where
&epsilon;<sub>d</sub>=cases(
Sqrt(d)&amp;if d &equiv; 2, 3 mod 4, cr
(1 + Sqrt(d)/2)&amp;if d &equiv; 1 mod 4.cr)
Elements of O<sub>F</sub> are represented by two integer coefficients &alpha;=x + y&epsilon;<sub>d</sub>.
The pair 1, &epsilon;<sub>d</sub> forms an integral basis for F=Q(Sqrt(d)),
but note that elements of F are represented using the basis of the 
equation order (1, Sqrt(d)) instead.
<P>
For any positive integer f there is a suborder of conductor f in
O<sub>F</sub>, whose elements are of the form x + y f &epsilon;<sub>d</sub>, for any integers
x, y. The discriminant of the order of conductor f is f<sup>2</sup>D, where
D is the field discriminant.
<P>
The equation order of F is E<sub>F</sub> = Z + Sqrt(d)Z. Suborders of conductor
f can be formed which will contain elements of the form x + y f Sqrt(d)
for any integers x and y.
