Here we describe the functions for working with the classification
of the semisimple subalgebras of the simple Lie algebras.
These subalgebras have been classified for the simple Lie algebras
over the complex numbers, of ranks up to 8. They have been classified
up to linear equivalence. Two subalgebras K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub> of a Lie algebra
L are linearly equivalent if for every representation of L the
induced representations of K<sub>1</sub>, K<sub>2</sub> are equivalent. 
The basic function for dealing with them returns a directed graph, 
describing the inclusions among the subalgebras, and having the subalgebras
as labels of the vertices. (We refer to <A  HREF = "text1129.htm#bib_wdg-sssdb">[dG11]</A> for 
the background details of this classification.)

Here t has to be a simple type of rank not exceeding 8. 
This function returns a directed graph G. The vertices of this
graph are numbered from 1 to the number of semisimple subalgebras.
Furthermore, the last vertex is numbered 0. A vertex has a label that
is the semisimple subalgebra corresponding to it. The label of the 
last vertex (numbered 0), has the Lie algebra L of type t as its
label. All other semisimple Lie algebras are subalgebras of this one.
<P>
The Lie algebra L (and its subalgebras) is defined over the rational numbers,
or over a cyclotomic field. It is sometimes necessary to take an extension,
because for some types not all subalgebras are defined over the 
rationals.
<P>
Moreover, in G there is an edge from the vertex with label K<sub>1</sub>
to the vertex with label K<sub>2</sub> if and only if K<sub>1</sub> has a subalgebra 
that is linearly equivalent (as subalgebra of L) to K<sub>2</sub>. We remark that
it does not mean that K<sub>2</sub> is a subalgebra of K<sub>1</sub> (rather that it is
linearly equivalent to a subalgebra of K<sub>1</sub>).

Here G is a subalgebras inclusion graph of the simple Lie algebra L, 
as output by the previous function, and k is a nonzero integer, 
corresponding to a vertex. This function returns the restriction matrix 
corresponding to L and the Lie algebra that is the label of the 
k-th vertex of G. This restriction matrix maps weights in a 
representation of L to weights of the subalgebra, and can be used
to decompose a representation of L, as a representation of the subalgebra.
