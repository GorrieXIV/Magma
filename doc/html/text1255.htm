This chapter describes modules over multivariate polynomial rings and
related rings.  The fundamental tool for computing with such modules
is the construction of Gr&ouml;bner bases for modules, since these rings are not
principal ideal rings in general (so standard matrix echelonization
algorithms are not applicable).
<P>
In this chapter, unless otherwise indicated,
a <B>ring</B> R will refer to one of the following:
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(a)</DT><DD><B>Multivariate Polynomial Ring</B>
    (Chapters <A  HREF = "text222.htm#1912">MULTIVARIATE POLYNOMIAL RINGS</A> and <A  HREF = "text1203.htm#13438">GR&Ouml;BNER BASES</A>).
    Currently the coefficient ring of such a ring may be a field or Euclidean ring
    (even operations such as syzygy modules or free resolutions work over
    modules whose coefficient rings are Euclidean but not fields).
<P>
<DT>(b)</DT><DD><B>Local Polynomial Ring</B> (Localization of a Multivariate Polynomial
    Ring: Chapter <A  HREF = "text1234.htm#13666">LOCAL POLYNOMIAL RINGS</A>; new in V2.15).  Currently the
    coefficient ring of such a ring must be a field.
<P>
<DT>(c)</DT><DD><B>Affine Algebra</B> (Chapter <A  HREF = "text1244.htm#13728">AFFINE ALGEBRAS</A>).
    Currently the coefficient ring of such a ring must be a field.
<P>
<DT>(d)</DT><DD><B>Exterior Algebra</B> (Chapter <A  HREF = "text925.htm#10476">FINITELY PRESENTED ALGEBRAS</A>; new in V2.15).
    Currently the coefficient ring of such a ring must be a field.  Strictly
    speaking, this is a skew-commutative ring, so is not a commutative
    ring, and the associated modules are left R-modules, but 
    the operations on R-modules in this chapter are practically all
    applicable if R is such an algebra also, so the term `a ring R'
    will include such an algebra in this chapter.
<P>
<P>

</DL>
In this chapter, the term "<B>module</B>" will always
refer to an R-module, where R is one of the above types of ring,
and such a module will have type <TT>ModMPol</TT> (or may have type <TT>ModMPolGrd</TT> if graded; see below).  So we assume that the reader is
generally familiar with such base rings and their ideals in Magma; see the
relevant chapters for background.  Many of the concepts and tools
of Gr&ouml;bner basis theory carry over from these types of rings.
