Magma has a database containing characteristic 0 representations of
some finite quasisimple groups. 
<P>


<H5><A NAME = "8695">QuasisimpleMatrixGroup(N, d, p : parameters) : MonStgElt, RngIntElt, RngIntElt -&gt;GrpMat</A></H5>

<PRE>    OverZ: BoolElt                      Default: <TT>true</TT> &lt;=&gt; p = 0</PRE>

<PRE>    Automorphisms: BoolElt              Default: <TT>false</TT></PRE>

<PRE>    RepNo: RngIntElt                    Default: 1</PRE>

Return an absolutely irreducible matrix group in characteristic p, which
may be a prime number or 0, derived from the reduction modulo p of
of an absolutely irreducible representation in characteristic 0 and
dimension d of the quasisimple group G with name N.
The generators of G used are its standard generators.
For those quasisimple groups in the ATLAS-database (Section <A  HREF = "text758.htm#8728">Database of ATLAS Groups</A>),
the same names are used as there.
Other quasisimple groups are named according to the same conventions.
<P>
If there is more than one representation of G in dimension d in the
database, then the first such is used by default, and the others can
be accessed by using the <TT>RepNo</TT> option.
<P>
If the reduction modulo p of the representation is not irreducible, then
a random non-trivial irreducible constituent is used. (This behaviour may change
in the future.)
<P>
For those representations that are not realisable over <B>Z</B> in
dimension d, a representation in dimension d over a minimal extension
of the rationals and also an irreducible representation in a higher dimension
over <B>Z</B> are both stored in the database. The representation used is
the one over <B>Z</B> if the parameter <TT>OverZ</TT> is <TT>true</TT>, and the
one over the number field otherwise. Reduction modulo p is generally faster
using the integral representation, so that is the default when p&gt;0.
<P>
If the parameter <TT>Automorphisms</TT> is set, then extra generators inducing
those outer automorphisms of G that stabilise the representation are
included in the group returned. This may result in extra scalars being
present in the group returned, and when p=0 this scalar subgroup can
sometimes be infinite.

<H5><A NAME = "8696">QuasisimpleMatrixGroups(): -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns a list of tuples specifying the names of the groups in the
quasisimple matrix group database, together with the dimension and the
number of stored representations of the group in that dimension.
