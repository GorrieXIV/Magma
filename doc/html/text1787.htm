A vertex labelling of a graph G is a partial map f from the vertex-set
   V of G into a set L.  
An edge labelling of a graph G is a partial map f from the edge-set
  E of G into a set L.  
A labelled graph is built by assigning labels successively to vertices or
  edges after the (unlabelled) graph has been constructed.
<P>
Similarly, a capacitated graph G is a partial map from its 
  edge-set into Z^ +, and a weighted graph G is a partial map from
  its edge-set into R, R any ring with a total order.
Those two last features are particularly convenient 
  when running shortest-paths and flow algorithms.
Edge capacities and edge weights are assigned to edges 
  once the graph has been constructed.
Any graph edge may carry a label, together with a capacity and/or a
  weight.
<P>
All the functions for decorating graph vertices and edges 
  are fully documented in Section <A  HREF = "text1813.htm#20066">Vertex and Edge Decorations</A> in 
  Chapter <A  HREF = "text1809.htm#20036">MULTIGRAPHS</A>.
A few examples are also given there.
