This online help node and the nodes below it present
the functions designed for computing with finitely-presented groups
(fp-groups for short). The name of the corresponding Magma category is
<A NAME = "GrpFP"><TT>GrpFP</TT></A>. The functions considered here are designed for doing
what is sometimes referred to as <I>combinatorial group theory</I>.

For a description of fundamental algorithms for finitely presented groups, we
refer the reader to <A  HREF = "text807.htm#bib_sims_fpgroups">[Sim94]</A>.


<H4><A NAME = "9092">The Construction of Finitely  Presented Groups</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
The construction of fp-groups utilises the fact that every group is a
quotient of some free group. Thus, two general fp-group constructors
are provided: <A  HREF = "text810.htm#GrpFP_1:FreeGroup">FreeGroup</A><TT>(n)</TT> which constructs a
free group of rank n,
and <A  HREF = "text811.htm#GrpFP_1:quo">quo</A><TT>&lt; F | R &gt;</TT> which constructs the quotient of
group F by the normal subgroup defined by the relations R.
<P>
The naming of generators presents special difficulties since they are
not always used in a consistent manner in the mathematical literature.
A generator name is used in two distinct ways. Firstly, it plays the
role of a <I>variable</I> having as its value a designated generator of 
G. Secondly, it appears as the <I>symbol</I> designating the specified 
generator whenever elements of the group are output. These two uses
are separated in the Magma semantics.
<P>
In Magma, a standard indexing notation is provided for referencing the 
generators of any fp-group G. Thus, <TT>G.i</TT> denotes the i-th generator 
of G. However, users may give individual names to the generators
by means of the <I>generator</I>-assignment. Suppose that the group G
is defined on r generators. Then if the right hand side of the following
statement creates a group, the special assignment
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; G&lt; v_1, ..., v_r&gt; := construction;
</PRE>
is equivalent to the statements
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; G := construction;
&gt;    v_1 := G.1;
&gt;    ...
&gt;    v_r := G.r;
</PRE>
It should be noted that when the fp-group G is created as the quotient
of the group F, any names that the user may have associated with the
generators of F will not be associated with the corresponding
generators of G. If this were allowed, then it would violate the
fundamental principle that every object is viewed as belonging to a 
<I>unique</I> structure.
