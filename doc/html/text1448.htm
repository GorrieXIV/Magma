<P>
<P>
This chapter deals with functionality that is specific to elliptic curves
defined over the rationals or over number fields.  As a general goal,
these functions are developed in parallel.  Naturally, machinery for
curves over Q has been developed much further than for general
number fields, although the latter has been a major focus of recent 
releases.
<P>
The material on computing the Mordell-Weil group (of rational points)
and descent methods is presented in the final part of the chapter,
and deals with all base fields at the same time.  The other topics
are presented separately for Q and for number fields, although
many of the functions are the same for both.
<P>
Note: functions declared for number fields can also be used over Q.
To do so, it may be necessary to construct Q as
<TT>RationalsAsNumberField()</TT> rather than <TT>Rationals()</TT>.
