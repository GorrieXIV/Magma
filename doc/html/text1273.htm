Magma contains a powerful module for computing with invariant
rings and fields of finite groups and algebraic groups.
The algorithms for invariant theory of finite groups in Magma are based on
those in the <I>Invar</I> package written in Maple, implemented by
G. Kemper <A  HREF = "text1271.htm#bib_Kemper_Invar">[Kem96]</A>, but also include many new ideas and
improvements which are described in detail in a subsequent
paper <A  HREF = "text1271.htm#bib_KemperSteel">[KS97]</A>. 
Since a detailed understanding of the latter paper is useful for better
understanding of many of the functions in the chapter, it is recommended
the paper be perused by anyone wishing to make serious applications of the
functions.
<P>
Since V2.14, Magma also has algorithms for invariant
theory of linear algebraic groups. In particular, Derksen's algorithm
<A  HREF = "text1271.htm#bib_Derksen99">[Der99]</A> and the algorithm by Beth and M&uuml;ller-Quade
<A  HREF = "text1271.htm#bib_MQB99">[MQB99]</A> have been implemented. These additions use code written
by G. Kemper.
<P>
The primary goal of invariant theory in Magma is the computation of
generators of the
invariant ring or field of a given group, which may be finite or
algebraic. The ground field may have arbitrary characteristic. In
invariant theory of finite groups,  the
<I>modular case</I>, i.e., the case where the characteristic of the ground
field K divides the group order, is of particular interest, since in that case there are still many
theoretical questions unanswered. Magma also contains easy algorithms
to calculate properties of modular invariant rings, such as the Hilbert series,
the Cohen-Macaulay property, depth, and free resolutions.
<P>
The approach to calculating the invariant ring of a finite group
is broken up into two major steps: first a system of <I>primary invariants</I>
is constructed, i.e., homogeneous invariants f<sub>1</sub>, ..., f<sub>n</sub> which are
algebraically independent, such that the invariant ring is a
finitely generated module over A = K[f<sub>1</sub>, ..., f<sub>n</sub>].
In the next step we calculate <I>secondary invariants</I>, which
are generators of the invariant ring as an A-module.
<P>
Throughout this chapter, K will be a field and G is a group acting linearly on the n-dimensional vector
space V isomorphic to K<sup>n</sup> with basis x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>. G may be a linear
algebraic group, in which case K is assumed to be algebraically
closed, or a finite matrix group, or a permutation group. G also acts on the
symmetric algebra K[V] = S(V), which is the multivariate polynomial ring
K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>]
in the variables x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>. The invariant ring R = {f &isin;K[V] | f<sup>&sigma;</sup> = f forall &sigma; &isin;G} is denoted by K[V]<sup>G</sup>. The
G-action extends naturally to the rational function field K(V) on
V, leading to the analogous definition of the invariants field
K(V)<sup>G</sup>.

Sections <A  HREF = "text1274.htm#13950">Creation</A> through <A  HREF = "text1279.htm#13968">Verbosity</A> describe the
general setup of invariant theory in Magma. Section <A  HREF = "text1280.htm#13970">Construction of Invariants of  Specified Degree</A>
is about computing invariants of specified
degree. Sections <A  HREF = "text1281.htm#13977">Construction of G-modules</A> through <A  HREF = "text1288.htm#14009">Properties of Invariant Rings</A> deal with
functions for invariant rings of finite groups. The following
Sections <A  HREF = "text1289.htm#14018">Steenrod Operations</A> and <A  HREF = "text1290.htm#14021">Minimalization and Homogeneous Module Testing</A> present some
functions whose scope is not limited to the context of invariant
theory. Sections <A  HREF = "text1292.htm#14032">Invariant Rings of Linear Algebraic Groups</A> and <A  HREF = "text1293.htm#14056">Functions for Invariant Fields</A>
are about functions for invariant rings of algebraic groups and for
invariant fields, respectively. The Section <A  HREF = "text1291.htm#14027">Attributes of Invariant Rings and Fields</A>
gives information about some low-level control of the data structures
associated to invariant theory.  Finally, since V2.14,
the Section <A  HREF = "text1292.htm#14032">Invariant Rings of Linear Algebraic Groups</A> deals
with invariant rings of algebraic groups and the
Section <A  HREF = "text1293.htm#14056">Functions for Invariant Fields</A> deals with invariant
fields.
