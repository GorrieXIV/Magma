Block matrices can be constructed either by listing the blocks, or by
joining together smaller matrices horizontally, vertically or diagonally.


<H5><A NAME = "2342">BlockMatrix(m, n, blocks) : RngIntElt, RngIntElt, [ Mtrx ] -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The matrix constructed from the given block matrices, which should all have the
same dimensions, and should be given as a sequence of m.n block
matrices (given in row major order, in other words listed across rows).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2343">BlockMatrix(m, n, rows) : RngIntElt, RngIntElt, [ [ Mtrx ] ] -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<H5>BlockMatrix(rows) : [ [ Mtrx ] ] -&gt; Mtrx</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The matrix constructed from the given block matrices, which should all
have the same dimensions, and should be given as a sequence of m rows,
each containing n block matrices.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2344">HorizontalJoin(X, Y) : Mtrx, Mtrx -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a matrix X with r rows and c columns, and a matrix Y
with r rows and d columns, both over the same coefficient ring R,
return the matrix over R with r rows and
(c + d) columns obtained by joining X and Y horizontally (placing
Y to the right of X).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2345">HorizontalJoin(Q) : [ Mtrx ] -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<H5>HorizontalJoin(T) : &lt; Mtrx &gt; -&gt; Mtrx</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sequence Q or tuple T of matrices, each having the same number of rows and
being over the same coefficient ring R,
return the matrix over R
obtained by joining the elements of Q or T horizontally in order.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2346">VerticalJoin(X, Y) : Mtrx, Mtrx -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a matrix X with r rows and c columns, and a matrix Y
with s rows and c columns, both over the same coefficient ring R,
return the matrix with (r + s) rows and c columns over R obtained
by joining X and Y vertically (placing Y underneath X).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2347">VerticalJoin(Q) : [ Mtrx ] -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<H5>VerticalJoin(T) : &lt; Mtrx &gt; -&gt; Mtrx</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sequence Q or tuple T of matrices, each having the same number
of columns and being over the same coefficient ring R,
return the matrix over R
obtained by joining the elements of Q or T vertically in order.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2348">DiagonalJoin(X, Y) : Mtrx, Mtrx -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given matrices X with a rows and b columns and Y with c rows
and d columns, both over the same coefficient ring R, return the
matrix with (a + c) rows and (b + d) columns over R obtained by
joining X and Y diagonally (placing Y diagonally to the right of
and underneath X, with zero blocks above and below the diagonal).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2349">DiagonalJoin(Q) : [ Mtrx ] -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<H5>DiagonalJoin(T) : &lt; Mtrx &gt; -&gt; Mtrx</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sequence Q or tuple T of matrices, each being over the same
coefficient ring R, return the matrix over R obtained by joining
the elements of Q or T diagonally in order.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "2350">KroneckerProduct(A, B) : Mtrx, Mtrx -&gt; Mtrx</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an m x n matrix A and a p x q matrix B, both
over a ring R, return the Kronecker product of A and B, which
is the mp x nq matrix C over R such that
the ((i - 1)p + r, (j - 1)q + s)-th entry of C is the
(i, j)-th entry of A times the (r, s)-th entry of B,
for 1&le;i&le;m, 1&le;j&le;n, 1&le;r&le;p and 1&le;s&le;q.
