The functions described in this section apply only to finite groups for
which a base and strong generating set may be constructed.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Construct a presentation for the matrix group G on the set of
defining generators and return the presentation in the form of a finitely
presented group F that is isomorphic to G. The presentation is
obtained by first computing the regular representation of G and then
using the Todd-Coxeter Schreier algorithm to construct a presentation on
the strong generators.  In this situation the strong generators are
identical to the defining generators.
<P>
A group homomorphism &phi;: F -&gt; G, defining G as a matrix
representation of F, is also returned.

<H5><A NAME = "7678">FPGroupStrong(G) : GrpMat -&gt; GrpFP, Hom(Grp)</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Construct a presentation for the matrix group G on a set of strong
generators and return the presentation in the form of a finitely presented
group F that is isomorphic to G. In Magma, the Todd-Coxeter Schreier
algorithm is used to construct the presentation. If strong generators
are not already known for G, they will be constructed. 
In the case in which strong generators are already
known for G, the presentation will be on these strong generators. 
<P>
The presentation will have the property that it contains presentations for all
stabilizer subgroups defined by the BSGS.
<P>
The group homomorphism f: F -&gt; G, defining G as a matrix 
representation of F, is also returned.

Consider a matrix group G defined on d generators. The <I>word group</I> of G is a free group W of rank d. Then we regard G
as a homomorphic image of F with associated homomorphism &phi;: W -&gt; G. All operations involving words in the generators of G
will be performed in W.


<H5><A NAME = "7680">WordGroup(G) : GrpMat -&gt; GrpSLP, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a matrix group G defined on d generators, return
(a) a free group W on d generators as an SLP-group, and (b) the
homomorphism &phi; from W to G such that W.i -&gt; G.i, for i = 1, ..., d. The group W associated with G
by this function will be referred to as the <I>word group</I> for G.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "7681">InverseWordMap(G) : GrpMat -&gt; Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a matrix group G and its associated word group W with
canonical homomorphism &phi;:W -&gt; G, construct the inverse
mapping &rho;. Thus, given a matrix g of G, g@&rho; returns
an element in the preimage of g under &phi;. If the word group W
does not already exist, it will be created.
