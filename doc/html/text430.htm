The following procedures allow one to simplify an algebraically closed
field so that it is a true field.

(Procedure.)
Simplify the algebraically closed field A so that the affine algebra which represents it is a true
field, modifying A in place.
Equivalently, simplify A so that the multivariate polynomial ideal
corresponding to the defining polynomials A is maximal.
<P>
The procedure first partially simplifies A by calling
<A  HREF = "text429.htm#FldAC:MinimalPolynomial">MinimalPolynomial</A> on all variables and sums of two variables of
A.  This will usually cause many simplifications, since this forces
the corresponding minimal polynomials to be irreducible
(see <A  HREF = "text429.htm#FldAC:MinimalPolynomial">MinimalPolynomial</A>).  The procedure then performs
all other necessary simplifications by successively computing
absolute representations and factorizing the absolute polynomials
which arise.  This may be very expensive (in particular, if the
final absolute degree is greater than 20), so is only practical
for fairly small degrees.
<P>
If the parameter <TT>Partial</TT> is set to <TT>true</TT>, then only the
partial simplification is performed, which is usually rather fast,
and may be sufficient.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Prune the algebraically closed field A by removing useless variables, modifying A in place.
That is, for each variable v of A such that its defining
polynomial is a linear polynomial, remove v and the corresponding
defining polynomial from A, and shift variables higher than v
appropriately.
<P>
Note that elements of A are kept reduced to normal
form with respect to the defining polynomials of A (at least
according the user's perception), so for each such v having a linear
relation, v cannot occur in any element of A, so the removal of v
from A is possible.
