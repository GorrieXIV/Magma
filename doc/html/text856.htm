The class of finitely presented groups defined by finite rewrite systems 
provide a Magma level interface to Derek Holt's KBMAG programs, and 
specifically to the Knuth--Bendix completion procedure for groups 
defined by a finite (monoid) presentation. Much of the material in this 
chapter is taken from the KBMAG documentation <A  HREF = "text854.htm#bib_KBMAG">[Hol97]</A>.
Familiarity with the Knuth--Bendix completion procedure is assumed. 
Some familiarity with KBMAG would be beneficial.

A rewrite group G is a finitely presented group in which equality between
elements of G, called <I>words</I> or <I>strings</I>, may be decidable via 
a sequence of rewriting
equations, called <I>reduction relations, rules, or equations</I>. In the
interests of efficiency the reduction rules are codified into a finite state
automaton called a <I>reduction machine</I>. The words
in a rewrite group G are ordered, as are the reduction relations of G.
Several possible orderings of words are supported, namely short-lex, 
recursive, weighted short-lex and wreath-product orderings.
A rewrite group can be <I>confluent</I> or <I>non-confluent</I>. If a rewrite 
group G is confluent its reduction relations, or more specifically its
reduction machine, can be used to reduce words
in G to their irreducible normal forms under the given ordering, and so the
word problem for G can be efficiently solved.

The family of all rewrite groups forms a category. The objects are the 
rewrite groups and the morphisms are group homomorphisms. The Magma 
designation for this category of groups is <A NAME = "GrpRWS"><TT>GrpRWS</TT></A>. Elements of a
rewrite group are designated as <A NAME = "GrpRWSElt"><TT>GrpRWSElt</TT></A>.

A rewrite group G is constructed in a three-step process:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>We construct a free group FG.
<P>
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>We construct a quotient F of FG.
<P>
<P>
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD>We create a monoid presentation of F and then run a 
Knuth--Bendix completion procedure on this presentation to create a 
rewrite group G.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
The Knuth--Bendix procedure may or may not succeed. If it fails the user may 
need to perform the above steps several times, manually adjusting the 
parameters to the Knuth--Bendix procedure. If it succeeds then the rewrite
system constructed will be confluent.
