An algebraic function g in a differential field extension M/F
satisfies a linear differential equation L(y)=0 with coefficients
in F&sub;M.
If the minimal polynomial of g over F is of degree n, then the
order of L is at most n.

Given the irreducible polynomial f(X)&isin;F[X], return the
monic differential operator over F of minimal degree
to which a formal root of f is a solution. 
The field F must be a differential field.
The base ring of the created differential operator is F.
<P>
The algorithm used in this function is straightforward.
If g is a root of an irreducible polynomial f(X)&isin;F[X], where
F is a differential field, then f(g)=0 induces a unique derivation
on g. 
The field M=F(g) is an algebraic 
differential field extension of F containing all derivatives of g.
If n is the degree of the polynomial f, then M/F is a field
extension of degree n.
This implies that there must be at least one non--trivial linear relation
between g, &delta;<sub>M</sub>(g), ..., &delta;<sub>M</sub><sup>n</sup>(g).
The linear relation between these elements
involving the lowest powers of &delta;<sub>M</sub><sup>i</sup> gives exactly the 
desired monic differential operator after a suitable normalization.
