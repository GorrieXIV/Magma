<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a cuspidal space M of Hilbert modular forms of level N, and an
ideal I dividing N, this constructs the subspace of M consisting of 
forms that are new at the ideal I (or that are new at N, if I is not given).  
More precisely, this is the complement of the space generated by all images 
under degeneracy maps of spaces of level N/P for primes P dividing I.
In the current implementation, I must be squarefree and coprime to N/I.
<P>
The <TT>NewSubspace</TT> of M is not necessarily represented as an explicit 
subspace of M: doing so is not always possible, or may not be optimal.  
(These choices are internal: the difference is not visible in the output.)
In many cases new subspace is obtained as an explicit subspace by computing degeneracy maps.  
In other case it is computed independently of M, using a quaternion order 
which is chosen automatically.  When the optional argument <TT>QuaternionOrder</TT> 
is specified, this will always be used (overriding other considerations).
The allowable orders are similar to those for full cuspidal spaces 
(see <TT>HilbertCuspForms</TT> above), with the difference that here 
the quaternion algebra is allowed to be ramified at finite primes 
dividing I.  When the algebra is indefinite, the finite primes 
where it is ramified must be precisely those dividing I.
<P>
In the non-parallel weight case, work may be saved by setting 
the optional argument <TT>RationalBasis</TT> to <TT>false</TT>.
This defers the computation of a "rational basis" of the new space   
(this is explained below).
By default, a rational basis is computed for <TT>NewSubspace(M)</TT>, 
and (equivalently) <TT>NewSubspace(M)</TT> where I equals <TT>Level(M)</TT>.
If it is defered, one may later set a "rational basis" for the new space 
using <TT>SetRationalBasis</TT>.

This is a procedure which changes the basis of M.  
A full explanation is given in the first part of Section <A  HREF = "text1662.htm#18581">Operators</A>.   
<P>
If the basis of M is already known to be a "rational basis",
then nothing is done; the basis of M is not modified.
In particular, this has no effect on spaces of parallel weight 2.
<P>
After this has been invoked, the basis of M is never modified again.

We investigate new forms and old forms with level dividing 3 over Q(Sqrt(10)).

Hence M3 must contain only oldforms (since there are two degeneracy maps M1 to M3,
whose images must be linearly independent).  We verify this now.
<P>

Next we consider level (3).

&gt; M9 := HilbertCuspForms(F, 3*OF);
&gt; Dimension(M9);

The remaining dimension 8 all comes from level 1 (via the four images of M1).
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; Dimension(NewSubspace(M9, primes[1]));
10
&gt; Dimension(NewSubspace(M9, primes[2]));

The dimensions indicate that the four degeneracy maps M1 to M9 have independent images.

This illustrates that new subspaces may be computed independently, not using the same
algorithm as for the full space.  We compute forms over the real subfield of Q(&zeta;<sub>7</sub>),
which has degree 3.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; _&lt;x&gt; := PolynomialRing(Rationals());
&gt; _&lt;zeta7&gt; := CyclotomicField(7);
&gt; F&lt;a&gt; := NumberField(MinimalPolynomial(zeta7 + 1/zeta7));
&gt; F;
Number Field with defining polynomial x^3 + x^2 - 2*x - 1 over the Rational Field
</PRE>
We consider forms of level 3 (which generates a prime ideal in F).
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; M := HilbertCuspForms(F, 3*Integers(F));
&gt; M;
Cuspidal space of Hilbert modular forms over
Number Field with defining polynomial x^3 + x^2 - 2*x - 1 over the Rational Field
   Level = Ideal of norm 27 generated by ( [3, 0, 0] )
   Weight = [ 2, 2, 2 ]
&gt; Mnew := NewSubspace(M);
&gt; Dimension(M);
1
&gt; Dimension(Mnew);

</PRE>
So in fact M equals its new subspace, and consists of just one newform.
However, different algorithms have been chosen to compute them, as indicated below.
(Algorithm I is chosen automatically for the new subspace because it is much faster.
It cannot be used for the full space, since over an odd degree field there is no 
quaternion algebra ramified at precisely the infinite places.)
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; IsDefinite(M);
false
&gt; IsDefinite(Mnew);
true
</PRE>
We now compute some eigenvalues of the newform generating the space, using both algorithms.  
(The computations for M<sub>new</sub> are entirely independent from those for M.)
