In this chapter we will discuss vector spaces and their linear transformations.
Let K be a field. In Magma, the standard K-vector space is taken to be 
the set of n-tuples over the field K, which we shall write as K<sup>(n)</sup>.
<P>
A rectangular matrix over a field K is considered to be an element of the
vector space consisting of all m x n matrices over K. This vector
space will be written as K<sup>(m x n)</sup>. Let U and V be K-vector
spaces of dimensions m and n, respectively. The set of all linear
transformations with domain U and codomain V will be denoted by 
Hom<sub>K</sub>(U, V). Once bases have been chosen for U and V, we may identify
Hom<sub>K</sub>(U, V) with K<sup>(m x n)</sup>. Thus, K<sup>(m x n)</sup>  is first
of all a vector space and all the normal vector space operations apply.
However, since it is also a set of mappings, some additional operations
arising from this characterization apply.
<P>
We shall use the term <I>vector space</I> or <I>K-vector space</I> (if we 
wish to emphasize the coefficient field) to refer to both the space K<sup>(n)</sup>
and the space K<sup>(m x n)</sup>. If we wish to differentiate between the
two, we shall use the term <I>tuple space</I> when referring to K<sup>(n)</sup>
and the term <I>matrix space</I> referring to K<sup>(m x n)</sup>.

The family of all finite dimensional vector spaces over a given field K 
forms a category, while the set of all finite dimensional vector spaces forms
a family of categories indexed by the field K. In this family of 
categories, objects are vector spaces and the morphisms are linear 
transformations. The (indexed family of) categories consisting of vector
spaces of n-tuples has the name <TT>ModTupFld</TT>, while the (indexed family of)
categories consisting of vector spaces of m x n-matrices has the
name <TT>ModMatFld</TT>.

Every vector space V defined over a field K is created either as a 
subspace of the row space K<sup>(n)</sup> (tuple spaces) or as a subspace of 
K<sup>(m x n)</sup> (matrix modules). Thus, the construction of a general 
vector space is a two step process:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>The appropriate row space K<sup>(n)</sup>, is constructed;
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>The required vector space V is then defined as a subspace or
quotient space of K<sup>(n)</sup>.</DL>
