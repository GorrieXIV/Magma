There are two ways to create a differential ring.
The first creation is a general creation of a differential ring, 
for which the user specifies the ring and its derivation.
The second creates a 
differential field which has the structure of a 
rational function field of transcendence degree 1 over its base field.
Its derivation is specified by a differential.
<P>
Once a differential ring is created one can ask for its
ring or field of fractions.


<H5><A NAME = "14073">DifferentialRing(P, f, C) : Rng, Map, Rng -&gt; RngDiff</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a ring P and derivation f acting on P,
return the differential ring isomorphic to P, 
with induced derivation f acting
on it, and ring of constants C.
The ring C should be a subring of P on which
f is zero.

Rational Field with derivation given by Mapping

<H5><A NAME = "14075">RationalDifferentialField(C) : Fld -&gt; RngDiff</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The differential field in one variable over the constant field C.
If this field is called F, say, then
the derivation on F is given by 
(d) / (1) (d) (F.1),
where F.1 is the variable of F, and (1) (d) (F.1) is its 
differential in the differential space of F.
Any exact field with polynomial GCD is valid input for C.

Given a differential ring R with n indeterminates and a sequence S 
of n strings, assign the elements of S to the names of the variables 
of R.

This procedure only changes the names used in the printing of the elements
of R. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><A NAME = "14082">Creation of Differential Ring  Elements</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
The easiest way to create an element in a given ring is to use the angle
bracket construction to attach names to the indeterminates of the ring.
Others are given below.


<H5><A NAME = "14083">Name(R,  i) : RngDiff, RngIntElt -&gt; RngDiffElt</A></H5>
