The general creation function for sheaves takes a graded module representing 
the sheaf and a scheme X on which it is supported.  Special constructors are
provided in the cases of the structure sheaf of X and the canonical sheaf of 
X, when X is locally Cohen-Macaulay and equidimensional. The user may also 
ask for Serre twists of a given sheaf. Other constructions deriving new sheaves 
from existing sheaves will be described in later sections.


<H5><A NAME = "14853">Sheaf(M, X) : ModMPol, Sch -&gt; ShfCoh</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an ordinary projective scheme X and a module M over the coordinate 
ring of the ambient of X, such that M is annihilated by the defining ideal 
of X, this function returns the sheaf defined by graded module M on scheme 
X.

<H5>StructureSheaf(X, n) : Sch, RngIntElt -&gt; ShfCoh</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an ordinary projective scheme X, this function returns the structure 
sheaf OX for X, which is the sheaf defined by the coordinate ring R<sub>X</sub> 
of X, as a module.
If the intrinsic is called with a second integer-valued argument n, 
the object returned is a twisted version of the sheaf, that is, Serre's 
twisting sheaf OX(n), which has R<sub>X</sub>(n) as its associated graded module 
(see Section 5, Chapter II of <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_hartshorne">[Har77]</A>).  These are all invertible 
sheaves on X and OX(1) is the sheaf OX(H) corresponding to the 
class of a hyperplane divisor H on X.

<H5>CanonicalSheaf(X, n) : Sch, RngIntElt -&gt; ShfCoh</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an ordinary projective scheme X, this function returns the canonical
sheaf KX for X. The scheme X should be an ordinary projective scheme 
which is equidimensional and locally Cohen-Macaulay. That is, all of the primary 
components of X should have the same dimension and its local rings should 
all be Cohen-Macaulay rings.  These conditions aren't checked by Magma as 
the necessary computations can be very expensive in general. A non-singular 
variety always satisfies these conditions, and many singular normal varieties 
do also. For example, any curve or normal surface will be equidimensional and 
locally Cohen-Macaulay.  The stronger condition of being <I>arithmetically</I> 
Cohen-Macaulay, can be checked by invoking the intrinsic <A  HREF = "text1351.htm#shf:arith_CM">IsArithmeticallyCohenMacaulay</A> 
with the structure sheaf of X as argument.
<P>
Under these conditions, X has a canonical sheaf KX, defined up to isomorphism,
which acts as a dualising sheaf. See Section 7, Chapter III of <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_hartshorne">[Har77]</A> 
and Chapter 21 of <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_EisenbudCommAlg">[Eis95]</A> for the module-theoretic background. 
For non-singular varieties, the canonical sheaf is the usual one: the highest 
alternating power of the sheaf of Kahler differentials. The function returns 
the canonical sheaf of X. It is computed from the dual complex to the minimal 
free resolution of the coordinate ring of X.
<P>
If the intrinsic is invoked with an additional integer argument n, it returns 
the nth Serre twist (see below) of the canonical sheaf KX(n). For a 
non-singular variety of dimension d, the map into projective space corresponding 
to KX(d - 1) is the important <I>adjunction map</I>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sheaf S, the function returns the nth Serre twist of Para, 
Para(n) isomorphic to Para tensor <sub>OX</sub>OX(n). If M is a module giving Para, 
then M(n) gives Para(n).

The equations x=z, y=t define an (exceptional) line in X. We can get its 
structure sheaf as a sheaf on X using the basic <TT>Sheaf</TT> constructor. 
The associated invertible sheaf (L)(Y) of Y as a divisor on X
can be obtained from the <TT>DivisorToSheaf</TT> intrinsic described later in
the chapter.

Given an ordinary projective scheme X, this function returns the sheaf of
1-differentials on X, &Omega;<sup>1</sup><sub>X/k</sub>. The function computes the natural 
representing module for the sheaf coming from the embedding of X in 
projective space (see Section 8, Chapter II of <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_hartshorne">[Har77]</A>). If the 
parameter <TT>Maximize</TT> is <TT>true</TT>, then the maximal module representing 
this sheaf is computed and used to define it (see next section).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For an ordinary projective scheme X, this function returns the sheaf of tangent 
vectors for X. The function computes the natural representing module for these
sheaves coming from the embedding of X in projective space (see Section 8, Chapter
II of <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_hartshorne">[Har77]</A>). If the parameter <TT>Maximize</TT> is <TT>true</TT>, then the maximal
module representing this sheaf is computed and used to define it (see next section).
<P>
Combining either of the above intrinsics with the <A  HREF = "text1351.htm#shf:loc-free">IsLocallyFree</A> intrinsic, 
this gives an alternative method for checking non-singularity on varieties that
are known to be (locally) Cohen-Macaulay. It is best to use the sheaf of 
differentials since that is generally easier to compute.  This approach can be 
much faster for varieties having high codimension than the usual Jacobian method.

The projective space P should be ordinary projective 4-space Prj<sup>4</sup> over a field. 
The function returns the locally free rank 2 sheaf on P which represents the 
Horrocks-Mumford bundle (see <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_HorMum73">[HM73]</A>). The scheme of vanishing of a general 
global section of this sheaf is a two dimensional Abelian variety in P.
