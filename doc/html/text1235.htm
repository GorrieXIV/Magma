This chapter describes local polynomial rings.
Let R be the multivariate polynomial ring K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>], where
K is a field.  We denote by
K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>]<sub>&lt; x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> &gt;</sub>
the collection of all rational functions f/g of x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>
with g(p) not= 0, where p=(0, ..., 0).  
Such a ring is <B>local</B> (has a unique maximal ideal) and
we will call it a <B>local polynomial ring</B> in Magma.  Such a ring
is always multivariate and is related to the corresponding
multivariate polynomial ring K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>] which will we
will call <B>global</B> (when distinguishing it from the local case).
We will also
call K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>]<sub>&lt; x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> &gt;</sub>
the <B>localization</B> of K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>] (this is always
understood to be at the prime ideal generated by x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>,
corresponding to the origin).
<P>
Much of the theory for multivariate polynomial rings and their ideals
carry over to local polynomial rings, so the reader should first
be familiar with multivariate polynomial rings and their ideals
(see Chapters <A  HREF = "text222.htm#1912">MULTIVARIATE POLYNOMIAL RINGS</A> and <A  HREF = "text1203.htm#13438">GR&Ouml;BNER BASES</A>).
<P>
Corresponding to a Gr&ouml;bner basis of an ideal of a global
multivariate ring is a <B>standard basis</B> of an ideal
of a local polynomial ring.
See <A  HREF = "text1233.htm#bib_UAG_CLO">[CLO98, Chapter 4]</A> or <A  HREF = "text1233.htm#bib_GrPf02">[GP02, Chapter 1]</A>
for the basics of the theory and algorithms.
<P>
The other facilities are currently basic but will be expanded in coming
versions.  But note that computations with R -modules, where R is
a local polynomial ring, are fully supported: see Chapter <A  HREF = "text1254.htm#13781">MODULES OVER MULTIVARIATE RINGS</A>.
