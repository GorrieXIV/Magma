<P>
<P>
<P>
Let A = R[G] be a group algebra defined in Magma,
where R is a unital ring with a matrix echelon algorithm
and G is a group. If A was constructed to use the
vector representation for its elements, then subalgebras
and left, right and two-sided ideals of A can be
constructed. If R is a field, then quotient algebras
of A are also possible.
<P>
<P>
A subalgebra or ideal of a group algebra A is not in general
a group algebra; hence, a different type is needed for these
objects. Two possibilities are provided in Magma.
The first is to construct the subalgebra or ideal to have type
<TT>AlgGrpSub</TT>: a subalgebra (which may be an ideal) of a group
algebra. Its elements are elements of the group algebra and it
remains closely connected to its defining group algebra.
By default, ideals of group algebras will be of this type.
<P>
<P>
The alternative is to create the subalgebra or ideal as an
associative algebra given by structure constants (type <TT>AlgAss</TT>).
The required structure constants
are easily computable from the group algebra. This is the default Magma
uses when creating subalgebras of a group algebra.
<P>
<P>
Regardless of the type given to a subalgebra or ideal, the inclusion map
back into the group algebra is also provided.

<P>
We demonstrate how the degrees of the absolutely irreducible characters
of a group can be found by computing the Wedderburn decomposition of the
group algebra over a suitable finite field.
Of course, this is neither the smartest nor the quickest way to get this
information. In the example we deal with an extraspecial group of order 3<sup>3</sup>.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; G := ExtraSpecialGroup(3, 1);
&gt; Exponent(G);
3
</PRE>
We have to choose a finite field that contains the roots of unity that may
be required by the absolutely irreducible characters. This is the case for
GF(q) if the exponent of G divides q - 1. In our example, q=4 or q=7
are possible choices.
<P>

&gt; FG := GroupAlgebra(GF(4), G);

Group algebra with vector representation and stored multiplication table

            25, 16)(8, 26, 17)(9, 27, 18)
        (1, 7, 4)(2, 8, 5)(3, 9, 6)(10, 18, 14)(11, 16, 15)(12, 17, 13)(19, 26,
            24)(20, 27, 22)(21, 25, 23)
        (1, 3, 2)(4, 6, 5)(7, 9, 8)(10, 12, 11)(13, 15, 14)(16, 18, 17)(19, 21,
            20)(22, 24, 23)(25, 27, 26)
&gt; MI := MinimalIdeals(FG);            
&gt; #MI;

</PRE>
The minimal ideals are the simple Wedderburn components of the group algebra,
corresponding to the absolutely irreducible characters of the group, and
their dimensions are the squares of the character degrees.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; [ Isqrt(Dimension(I)) : I in MI ];
[ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 3 ]
</PRE>
Hence, there are 9 linear characters and two of degree 3 (which we might have
concluded immediately from the fact that the derived quotient of G has
order 9).
