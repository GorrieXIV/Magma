This section describes some special issues arising with the identification of
a finitely presented group using the database of small groups described in
Section <A  HREF = "text744.htm#8512">Database of Small Groups</A>.

Locate the pair of integers &lt; o, n &gt; so that
<TT>SmallGroup(o, n)</TT> is isomorphic to G. If the construction of a
permutation representation for G fails or if there is no group
isomorphic to G in the database, then an error will result.
<P>
<P>
When trying to look up a finitely presented group G in the database
of small groups, Magma tries to construct a permutation
representation of G by enumerating the cosets of the trivial
subgroup in G.  Assuming that a group isomorphic to G is contained
in the database, the resulting coset table will be fairly small.
Hence for performance reasons, a coset limit of 100.o is
imposed, where o is the maximal order of groups in the database,
unless the order of G is <I>known</I> to be less or equal to o.
If, on the other hand, |G|&le;o is known, the global set of
parameters for implicitly invoked coset enumerations applies. This
set of parameters can be changed using the function
<A  HREF = "text814.htm#GrpFP_1:SetGlobalTCParameters">SetGlobalTCParameters</A>.
<P>
If the coset enumeration for G fails with the coset limit
100.o, this can be seen as a reasonable indication that
G is probably too large to be contained in the database of small
groups.
<P>
To deal with cases where the coset enumeration fails although G is
known or suspected to be small enough, it is recommended to attempt
to compute the order of G using the function <A  HREF = "text814.htm#GrpFP_1:Order">Order</A>
before the actual group identification.  If G that way can be
shown to be small enough to be contained in the database, the function
<A  HREF = "text814.htm#GrpFP_1:SetGlobalTCParameters">SetGlobalTCParameters</A> can be used to control the
behaviour of coset enumerations in a subsequent call to
<TT>IdentifyGroup</TT>.  The following example illustrates this.

Consider the group defined by the presentation
  &lt;  a, b | (ba<sup> - 1</sup>)<sup>3</sup>,  (ba<sup> - 1</sup>b)<sup>2</sup>, 
      a<sup>12</sup>b<sup>2</sup>a<sup>7</sup>b<sup>2</sup>ab<sup>2</sup>  &gt;.

&gt; G := Group&lt;a,b | (b*a^-1)^3, (b*a^-1*b)^2,
&gt;                  a^12*b^2*a^7*b^2*a*b^2 &gt;;
</PRE>
We suspect (for some reason) that G is a small group and want to identify
its isomorphism type in the database of small groups.

Runtime error in 'IdentifyGroup': Coset enumeration failed; group
may be too large (see handbook entry for details)
</PRE>
The group couldn't be identified, because it was not possible to obtain a
permutation representation with the default value of the coset limit.
<P>
Since we still think the group should be small, we try to prove this using
the function <A  HREF = "text814.htm#GrpFP_1:Order">Order</A>.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; Order(G : Print := true);
INDEX = 6 (a=6 r=66709 h=999999 n=999999; l=1247 c=1.56; m=969169
t=999998)

We were correct; the group is in fact very small. However, we can see from
the output of the <TT>Order</TT> command that this wasn't that easy to find
out: almost one million cosets were used in the coset enumeration.
<P>
Since the order of G is now known to the system, a subsequent call to
<TT>IdentifyGroup</TT> will now use the global parameters for implicitly
invoked coset enumerations. To be on the safe side, we tell the system
to be prepared to work a little harder using the function
<A  HREF = "text814.htm#GrpFP_1:SetGlobalTCParameters">SetGlobalTCParameters</A> and try again to identify G.

Now G can be identified.

When a finitely-presented group is known to small, it may be useful to
write it concretely as a permutation or PC-group.
There are two utilities provided for this purpose.


<H5><A NAME = "9442">PermutationGroup(G) : GrpFP -&gt; GrpPerm, GrpHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Construct a faithful permutation representation of G, and the isomorphism
from G to the representation. The algorithm first computes the order of
G, then takes the regular representation of G, and reduces the degree.
Thus the command is restricted to small groups.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "9443">PCGroup(G) : GrpFP -&gt; GrpPC, GrpHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Construct a faithful PC-group representation of G, and the isomorphism
from G to the representation. The algorithm first computes the order of
G, then computes the soluble quotient of G with the order found.
Thus the command is restricted to small soluble groups.
