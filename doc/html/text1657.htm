<P>
<P>
The first version of this package was released in V2.15
(December 2008).  It has been developed further in each
subsequent release, and is still under development.  
We encourage users to send feedback regarding the package,
and desirable features or improvements. 
<P>
The package contains implementations of two separate algorithms.
The primary focus is on parallel weight 2.
Higher weight spaces (including non-parallel weight) are also handled; 
however some features are only available for weight 2, 
and the main routines are better optimized in weight 2.     
All levels &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N) are allowed; some spaces with 
nontrivial character are also handled.
<P>
The main purposes of the current functionality are to efficiently 
compute Hecke operators on these spaces, to decompose spaces into 
newforms, and to efficiently obtain large numbers of eigenvalues 
for newforms (at least those having small degree).  
Some additional features such as Atkin-Lehner operators
are also included.

Hilbert modular forms are a generalization of classical modular forms
where the modular group is replaced by a subgroup of GL<sub>2</sub>(Z<sub>F</sub>)
where Z<sub>F</sub> is the ring of integers in a totally real number field.
This section gives a brief and partly informal introduction to
Hilbert modular forms.  The sections about the algorithms also 
introduce quaternionic modular forms and the Jacquet-Langlands
theory in order to use the package!
<P>
The books by Freitag <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_freitag">[Fre90]</A> and Garrett <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_garrett">[Gar90]</A>
are good references for standard material on Hilbert modular forms.
<P>
Let F be a totally real field of degree n over Q, with ring of integers Z<sub>F</sub>.  
Let v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>n</sub> be the embeddings of F into R.  
For x&isin;F, we write x<sub>i</sub> as a shorthand for v<sub>i</sub>(x).  
Each embedding v<sub>i</sub> induces an embedding v<sub>i</sub>:(Mat)<sub>2</sub>(F) -&gt; (Mat)<sub>2</sub>(R).  
Extending our shorthand to matrices, for &gamma;&isin;(Mat)<sub>2</sub>(F) we write &gamma; for v<sub>i</sub>(&gamma;).  
Let
<P>
GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F) = { &gamma;&isin;GL<sub>2</sub>(F) : (det) &gamma;<sub>i</sub> &gt; 0  for  all  i }.
<P>
The group GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F) acts on the cartesian product H<sup>n</sup> by the rule
<P>
&gamma;(&tau;, ..., &tau;<sub>n</sub>)=(&gamma;&tau;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &gamma;&tau;<sub>n</sub>)
<P>
where as usual GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (R) acts on H by linear fractional transformations.
<P>
Let &gamma;= pmatrix( a &amp; b  cr c &amp; d ) &isin;GL<sub>2</sub>(R) and &tau;&isin;H.  We define
<P>
j(&gamma;, &tau;) = c&tau; + d&isin;C.
<P>
For a <I>weight</I>  k=(k<sub>1</sub>, ..., k<sub>n</sub>) &isin;(Z<sub>&gt;0</sub>)<sup>n</sup>, 
we define a right <I>weight-k action</I> of GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F) on the space of complex-valued functions on H<sup>n</sup> by
<P>
(f(|<sub>k</sub>) &gamma;)(&tau;)=f(&gamma;&tau;)&prod;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>n</sup> ((det)&gamma;)<sup>k<sub>i</sub>/2</sup>j(&gamma;, &tau;<sub>i</sub>)<sup> - k<sub>i</sub></sup>
<P>
for f : H<sup>n</sup> to C and &gamma; &isin;GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F).  
The center F<sup> x </sup> of GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F) acts trivially on such f.   
Therefore, the weight-k action descends to an action of PGL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F)=GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (F)/F<sup> x </sup>.
<P>
Now let N be a (nonzero) ideal of Z<sub>F</sub>.  Define
<P>
&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N)= { pmatrix( a &amp; b  cr c &amp; d ) &isin;GL<sub>2</sub>^ + (Z<sub>F</sub>) : c&isin;N }.
<P>
A <I>Hilbert modular cusp form of weight-k and level &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N)</I> 
is an analytic function f:H<sup>n</sup>to C such that f(|<sub>k</sub>)&gamma;=f 
for all &gamma;&isin;&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N) and such that f vanishes at the cusps of &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N).  
<P>
<P>
When F has narrow class number 1, it is possible to define double coset operators in the same way 
as for classical modular forms; among these are Hecke operators, Atkin-Lehner operators and degeneracy maps.  
More precisely, the definitions work for primes in the trivial ideal class.
In the general case, the adelic definition of Hilbert modular forms is more convenient for the
purpose of defining operators, among other considerations.  We refer to the book by Freitag <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_freitag">[Fre90]</A>.


<H4><A NAME = "18554">Algorithms and the Jacquet-Lang-lands Correspondence</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
Two separate algorithms are implemented for computing the Hecke action on 
cuspidal spaces of Hilbert modular forms.  Both rely on the <I>Jacquet-Langlands correspondence</I>,
which states that the Hecke action on a space of Hilbert cusp forms is the same as the
Hecke action on a space of automorphic forms on some order in a suitable quaternion algebra.
See <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_hida">[Hid06]</A> for definitions of quaternionic automorphic forms and the correspondence.
<P>
Let F be a totally real field of degree n over Q. 
Algorithm I uses a definite quaternion algebra over F (ramified at all n infinite places).
Algorithm II uses the Shimura curve associated to a quaternion algebra ramified at exactly n - 1 infinite places.
By default, the algorithm (and the quaternion order to be used) are selected automatically, 
but can also be specified by the user.  
The essential requirement is that the quaternion order can be ramified only at primes p
for which the space is p-new.
The required conditions are stated fully in the descriptions of the commands <TT>HilbertCuspForms</TT> 
and <TT>NewSubspace</TT>.  It is worth noting that a different algorithm and order may be selected 
for a newspace than for the space containing it.  In fact, there is more freedom for a new space; 
in particular, over Q neither algorithm can compute full spaces, but can compute new subspaces for nonsquare levels.
<P>
Algorithm II is implemented only for parallel weight 2 (weight [2, 2, ..., 2]).
In the current implementation, Algorithm I is more optimized than Algorithm II, 
and therefore should be preferred in most cases.
For spaces over odd degree fields with level not divisible by any small primes,
Algorithm II may be preferable.
<P>
An exposition of both algorithms is given in <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_dembele-voight">[DV12]</A>,
in addition to the references mentioned in the following two sections.


<H4><A NAME = "18555">Algorithm I (Using Definite  Quaternion Orders)</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
This algorithm, described in <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_dembele-math-comp">[Dem07]</A> and <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_dembele-donnelly">[DD08]</A>,
is an efficient formulation of the Brandt module approach to computing modular forms.  
<P>
A key advantage of this algorithm is that the most expensive steps come in the 
precomputation phase (computations depending only on the quaternion algebra). 
This means that for a given number field, forms of many different levels and weights 
can be computed based on the same precomputation.


<H4><A NAME = "18556">Algorithm II (Using Indefinite  Quaternion Orders)</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
This algorithm, described in <A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_greenberg-voight">[GV11]</A>, is based on computing the
homology of a Shimura curve (and therefore is closer to the usual modular symbols 
algorithm over Q than Algorithm I).
Voight's algorithm (<A  HREF = "text1655.htm#bib_voight-fundamental-domain">[Voi09]</A>) for the fundamental domain 
of the action of the Fuchsian group on the upper half plane is applied. 
The algorithm simultaneously determines a fundamental domain and generators and relations 
for the fundamental group.
From this a description of the homology is obtained, in such a way that the Hecke action 
on it can then be explicitly calculated.


<H4><A NAME = "18557">Categories</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
The Magma category for spaces of Hilbert modular forms is <TT>ModFrmHil</TT>, 
while elements in these spaces have type <TT>ModFrmHilElt</TT>.


<H4><A NAME = "18558">Verbose Output</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
To see some information printed during computation about what the program is doing, 
use <TT>SetVerbose("ModFrmHil",n)</TT>, where <TT>n</TT> is 0 (silent, by default), 
1 (prints concise information), 2 or 3 (which may display bulky data).
