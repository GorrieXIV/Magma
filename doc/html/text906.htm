If the coefficient ring R of an algebra A is a Euclidean domain 
then one may construct submodules and ideals of A in Magma.


<H5><A NAME = "10228">sub&lt; A | L &gt; : AlgGen, List -&gt; AlgGen, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create the subalgebra S of the algebra A that is
generated by the elements defined by L,
where L is a list of one or more items of the following types:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(a)</DT><DD>An element of A;
<DT>(b)</DT><DD>A set or sequence of elements of A;
<DT>(c)</DT><DD>A subalgebra or ideal of A;
<DT>(d)</DT><DD>A set or sequence of subalgebras or ideals of A.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
The constructor returns the subalgebra as an algebra of the same type as A.
An exception are group algebras, where the subalgebra is either of type
<TT>AlgAss</TT> or of the special type <TT>AlgGrpSub</TT>.
As well as the subalgebra S itself, the constructor returns the inclusion
homomorphism f : S -&gt; A.

<H5><A NAME = "10229">lideal&lt; A | L &gt; : AlgGen, List -&gt; AlgGen, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create the left ideal I of the algebra A
generated by the elements defined by L,
where L is a list as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor above.
<P>
The constructor returns the left ideal as an algebra of the same type as A
with the same exception for group algebras as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor.
As well as the left ideal I itself, the constructor returns the inclusion
homomorphism f : I -&gt; A.

<H5><A NAME = "10230">rideal&lt; A | L &gt; : AlgGen, List -&gt; AlgGen, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create the right ideal I of the algebra A
generated by the elements defined by L,
where L is a list as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor above.
<P>
The constructor returns the right ideal as an algebra of the same type as A
with the same exception for group algebras as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor.
As well as the right ideal I itself, the constructor returns the inclusion
homomorphism f : I -&gt; A.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "10231">ideal&lt; A | L &gt; : AlgGen, List -&gt; AlgGen, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create the (two-sided) ideal I of the algebra A
generated by the elements defined by L,
where L is a list as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor above.
<P>
The constructor returns the right ideal as an algebra of the same type as A
with the same exception for group algebras as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor.
As well as the ideal I itself, the constructor returns the inclusion
homomorphism f : I -&gt; A.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><A NAME = "10232">Quotient Algebras</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
If the coefficient ring R of an algebra A is a field, 
then quotient algebras of A may also be constructed.


<H5><A NAME = "10233">quo&lt; A | L &gt; : AlgGen, List -&gt; AlgGen, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Create the quotient algebra Q = A / I, where I is the two-sided ideal of
A generated  by the elements of A specified by the list L, which
should satisfy the same conditions as for the <TT>sub</TT> constructor
above.
<P>
The constructor returns the quotient as a structure constant
algebra with degree equal to its dimension. If A is known to be associative,
then Q is of type <TT>AlgAss</TT>, otherwise Q is of type <TT>AlgGen</TT>.
As well as the quotient Q itself, the constructor returns the natural
homomorphism f : A -&gt; Q.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "10234">A / S : AlgGen, AlgGen -&gt; AlgGen</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The quotient of the algebra A by the (two-sided) ideal closure of its
subalgebra S.
