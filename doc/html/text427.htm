<H5><A NAME = "4406">BaseField(A) : FldAC -&gt; Fld</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return the base field over which A is defined.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "4407">Rank(A) : FldAC -&gt; RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return the current rank of A, that is, the number of variables which
currently define A.  This can increase by the construction of new
roots, or decrease by pruning (see <A  HREF = "text425.htm#FldAC:Roots">Roots</A> and
<A  HREF = "text430.htm#FldAC:Prune">Prune</A> respectively
below), so the return value of this function is <I>variable</I>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "4408">Degree(A, v) : FldAC, RngIntElt -&gt; RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an algebraically closed field A of rank r and an integer v in the range 1&le;v&le;r, return the current degree of the defining polynomial for
variable v.
The return value of this function is <I>variable</I>,
as A may be simplified between invocations, making the defining
polynomial for v have smaller degree.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "4409">Degree(A) : FldAC -&gt; RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return the current absolute degree of A, that is, the degree over its
base field.  This necessitates the simplification of A (see
<A  HREF = "text430.htm#FldAC:Simplify">Simplify</A> below), so may be very time consuming.  The return value
varies only when new roots of polynomials over the field are computed,
but until then, the return value is invariable (as the field will remain
simplified, even if <A  HREF = "text430.htm#FldAC:Prune">Prune</A> or <A  HREF = "text431.htm#FldAC:Absolutize">Absolutize</A> is
called -- see below).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "4410"></A><A NAME = "FldAC:AffineAlgebra">AffineAlgebra</A>(A) : FldAC -&gt; RngMPolRes</H5>
<H5>QuotientRing(A) : FldAC -&gt; RngMPolRes</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return the affine algebra (or multivariate quotient ring) R which
currently represents A.  The quotient relations of R consist
of the defining polynomials A, and one may coerce between A and R,
but note that the variable numbers are inverted.  The reason for this
is that for the system to work, the first root A.1 must be the
smallest variable with respect to the lexicographical order in the
corresponding affine algebra R, so that reductions modulo the
Gr&ouml;bner basis of relations are in the correct form.
<P>
Note also that if A changes in any way (whether from simplification
or by pruning), then the affine algebra R of course stays the same
and will not be comparable with the new form of A if A has a
different number of variables than before.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "4411">Ideal(A) : FldAC -&gt; RngMPol</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return the ideal of defining polynomials currently defining A.  This
is simply equivalent to <TT>DivisorIdeal(AffineAlgebra(A))</TT>.
See the relevant comments for the function <A  HREF = "text427.htm#FldAC:AffineAlgebra">AffineAlgebra</A>.
