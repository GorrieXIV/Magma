The homology H<sub>1</sub>(A, R) of an abelian
variety A with coefficients in a ring R is a free R-module of rank equal to twice the dimension
of A.  For many purposes, we view abelian varieties as complex tori
V/&Lambda;, so there is a canonical isomorphism &Lambda; isomorphic to H<sub>1</sub>(A, Z).   (If the sign of A is &#8723; 1, then the homology
command below gives a Z-module of rank dim A.)

This homology is just a free module over R

The code below illustrates that the lattice need not just be
the free lattice on dim(H) generators.  For
efficiency reasons many internal computations only require knowing
H<sub>1</sub>(A, Q), which is sometimes all that gets computed, and the lattice
returned by this command is H<sub>1</sub>(A, Z) written with respect to a
basis for H<sub>1</sub>(A, Q).  Thus <TT>Lattice</TT> should be viewed as
giving an integral structure of H<sub>1</sub>(A, Q).

If H is the homology of an abelian variety that is attached to a
space of modular symbols, then H remembers that space of modular
symbols.  The following two functions decide if H is
attached to modular symbols, and if so provide the corresponding spaces
of modular symbols.  The reason that <TT>ModularSymbols</TT> returns
a sequence instead of a single modular symbols space is that arbitrary
finite products of abelian varieties are allowed, so corresponding
direct sums of modular symbols spaces must be allowed, which are
represented as sequences because Magma currently doesn't have a
facility for taking direct sums of modular symbols spaces.

then display the corresponding spaces of modular symbols.
