Let D be an incidence structure with v points.
A <I>resolution</I>
  of D is a partition of the blocks of D
  into classes C<sub>i</sub> such that each class is a 1-design
  with v points and index &lambda;.
The positive integer &lambda; is called the <I>index</I>
  of the resolution.
A resolution with &lambda; = 1 is called a 
  <I>parallelism</I>.
In this case the classes C<sub>i</sub> are called 
  <I>parallel classes</I>.
<P>
All the functions which deal  with resolutions  apply to general incidence 
  structures.
The functions <TT>HasParallelism</TT>, <TT>AllParallelisms</TT>, <TT>HasParallelClass</TT>,
  <TT>IsParallelClass</TT> and <TT>AllParallelClasses</TT> 
  require that the incidence structure be uniform.
The function <TT>IsParallelism</TT> however applies to a general 
  incidence structure.


<H5><A NAME = "19585">HasResolution(D) : Inc -&gt; BoolElt, { SetEnum }, RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return <TT>true</TT> if and only if the incidence structure D has a resolution.
If <TT>true</TT>, one resolution is returned as the second value of the function 
and the  index of the resolution is returned as the third value.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19586">HasResolution(D, &lambda;) : Inc, RngIntElt -&gt; BoolElt, { SetEnum }</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return <TT>true</TT> if and only if the incidence structure D has a resolution
  with index  &lambda;.
If <TT>true</TT>, one such resolution is returned as the second value of 
the function.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19587">AllResolutions(D) : Inc  -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns all resolutions of the incidence structure D.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19588">AllResolutions(D, &lambda;) : Inc, RngIntElt  -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns all resolutions of the incidence structure D having index &lambda;.
When the problem is to find all parallelisms (&lambda; = 1) in 
  a uniform design D, it is best to use the function
  <TT>AllParallelisms</TT> described below.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19589">IsResolution(D, P) : Inc, SetEnum[SetEnum] -&gt; BoolElt, RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the set P of blocks (or sets) is a resolution
  of the incidence structure D.
If <TT>true</TT>, also returns the index of the resolution as the second value 
  of the function.

<PRE>    Al: MonStg                          Default: "Backtrack"</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the uniform incidence structure D has a parallelism.
If <TT>true</TT>, a parallelism is returned as the second value of the function.
The parameter <TT>Al</TT> allows the user to specify the algorithm used.
<P>
<P>
<TT>Al := "Backtrack"</TT>: A backtrack search is employed. 
This is in general very efficient when the design D is
  parallelizable, irrespective of the number of blocks.  
In particular, it compares very favourably with the 
  algorithm <TT>Clique</TT>, described below.  
The later algorithm is recommended when the design appears 
  to have no parallelism.
Backtrack is the default.
<P>
<P>
<TT>Al := "Clique"</TT>: This algorithm proceeds in two stages.  
Assume that D has v points and b blocks of size k. 
Define the graph G<sub>1</sub> of D to be the graph whose vertices 
  are the blocks of D and
  where two blocks are adjacent if and only if they are disjoint. 
The first stage of the Clique algorithm involves constructing the graph
  G<sub>1</sub> and finding all cliques of size v/k in G<sub>1</sub>.  
Any such clique is a parallel class of D.  
The second stage involved building a graph G<sub>2</sub> of D where 
  the vertices are the parallel classes of D and two
  parallel classes are adjacent if and only if they are disjoint.  
The second stage of the Clique algorithm involves searching for cliques of
  size b/(v/k) in G<sub>2</sub>.  
If such a clique exists then it yields a parallelism of D.
  (This algorithm was communicated by Vladimir Tonchev).
<P>
The clique algorithm is recommended when the design is suspected of
  having no parallelism.  
As an example, in the case of a non--parallelizable
  design with 272 blocks, Clique took around 0.1 second to complete as
  compared to 2 seconds for the backtrack algorithm. 
For a non--parallelizable design having 6642 blocks, 
  Clique took around four hours to complete as compared 
  to Backtrack which did not complete in 15 hours.  
Apart from performing very poorly when D has a parallelism,
  Clique may require a considerable amount of memory.  
It is recommended that Backtrack be tried first, 
  and if it does not complete in a
  reasonable amount of time, then Clique should be used.

<H5><A NAME = "19591">AllParallelisms(D) : Inc  -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns all parallelisms of the uniform incidence structure D.
This function is to be preferred to the function <TT>AllResolutions(D, 1)</TT>
  when D is uniform.
This is the case since the implementation of <TT>AllParallelClasses</TT>
  implies finding cliques in graphs (see the algorithm Clique
  described in the function <TT>HasParallelism</TT>), while 
  <TT>AllResolutions</TT> performs a full backtrack search.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19592">IsParallelism(D, P) : Inc, SetEnum[SetEnum] -&gt; BoolElt, RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if  the set P of blocks (or sets) is a parallelism
  of the incidence structure D.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19593">HasParallelClass(D) : Inc -&gt; BoolElt, { IncBlk }</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the uniform incidence structure D has a parallel 
  class.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19594">IsParallelClass(D, B, C) : Inc, IncBlk, IncBlk -&gt; BoolElt, { IncBlk }</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the uniform incidence structure D has a parallel 
  class containing the blocks B  and C.
If such a parallel class does exist, one is returned as the second
  value of the function.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19595">AllParallelClasses(D) : Inc -&gt;  SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns all  parallel classes of the uniform incidence structure D.
