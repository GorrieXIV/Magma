The Newton polygon of a differential operator L 
and its Newton polynomials can be used to factorize L.
A classical example of the Newton polygon uses the  
derivation z.d/dz, where z is a generator of the basefield of L.
This Newton polygon is known as <I>the</I> Newton polygon of L.
Its definition, as used in magma, is given in Para 3 of <A  HREF = "text1296.htm#bib_vH97">[vH97b]</A> and
is applicable to operators over a Laurent series ring with generator z, 
as well as to
operators over fields for which a set of places exist. 
For fields in the latter category it is however not necessary to 
restrict to the derivation z.d/dz
based at z=0 (in other words: at the place (z)).
More generally, the Newton polygon of L at the place (p) is
the Newton polygon at t=0 after rewriting L as a differential
operator tilde(L) in a local parameter t of (p), such that 
derivation of tilde(L) is of the form t.d/dt.


<H5><A NAME = "14331">NewtonPolygon(L) : RngDiffOpElt -&gt; NwtnPgon, RingDiffOpElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns the Newton Polygon of the differential operator L over a 
differential Laurent series ring.
This means that for the computation of the Newton polygon L may have had to 
be rewritten as a differential operator tilde(L) over a differential Laurent 
series ring C((t)), say, such that tilde(L) has derivation t.d/dt.
The second argument returned is the operator tilde(L).
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14332">NewtonPolygon(L, p) : RngDiffOpElt, PlcFunElt -&gt; NwtnPgon, RingDiffOpElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns the Newton polygon of the differential
operator L at the place p.
The derivation of L must be defined with respect to a differential
and the base ring of L should have one generator.
For the computation of the Newton polygon another differential operator
tilde(L), say, may have had to be calculated. 
The differential of the derivation of tilde(L)
has valuation -1 at the place p. 
The differential operator tilde(L) is also returned.

<H5><A NAME = "14333">NewtonPolynomial(F) : NwtnPgonFace -&gt; RngUPolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns the Newton polynomial of the face F of a Newton polygon.
The Newton polygon must have been created with respect to a differential 
operator.
The Newton polynomial depends on a uniformizing element,
therefore, its variable is well--defined up to scalar multiplication by
a non--zero element.
The definition of the Newton polynomial of a face that
is used by magma, is given in Section 3 of <A  HREF = "text1296.htm#bib_vH97">[vH97b]</A>.

<H5><A NAME = "14334">NewtonPolynomials(L) : RngDiffOpElt -&gt; SeqEnum, SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns all Newton polynomials of L with respect to the faces of
its Newton polygon. 
The second argument returned is the corresponding slopes.
