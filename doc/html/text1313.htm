All functions treated in this section concern differential
operator rings defined over a function field of
transcendence degree one.
They all require that the derivation of such an operator ring F[D] over F
is defined with respect to a differential.
<P>
Any solution of a differential operator L&isin;F[D] is also a solution 
of the operator c.L, for any non--zero c&isin;F.
For considering solutions we may therefore consider L to be monic
of the form
 L =  D<sup>n</sup> + a<sub>n - 1</sub>D<sup>n - 1</sup> + ... + a<sub>0</sub>,
with coefficients a<sub>i</sub>&isin;F for i=1, 2, ... n - 1.
Each of the coefficients is a rational function in F.
They play an important role in the rational solutions of L(y)=0 in F
that come to expression in so-called regular and singular places.

Given a place (q) in the set of places of F,
a putative rational solution y&isin;F of L(y)=0 has a q-adic expansion
<P>
  y = y<sub>&alpha;</sub> q<sup> &alpha;</sup> + y<sub>&alpha; + 1</sub> q<sup>&alpha; + 1</sup> + ... It has a pole at the place (q) if the valuation &alpha; is negative.
After substituting this solution in L(y) it becomes clear that
there is only a finite number of places which can occur as poles of
an arbitrary solution of Ly=0.
Such a place is either a pole of one of the coefficients a<sub>i</sub> or a zero or a 
pole of the differential &omega; of F[D].
There exists a classification 
for the poles of solutions of L(y)=0.
<P>
Given a place (q) and local parameter t at (q), the differential
operator can be rewritten as a differential operator tilde(L)&isin;tilde(F)[tilde(D)],
with tilde(F) isomorphic to F,
the valuation of whose differential at (q) is 0.
The place (q) is defined to be a <I>singular place</I> of L,
if one of the coefficients of tilde(L) has negative valuation at (q).
Places that are not singular are called <I>regular</I>.
<P>
There are two kinds of singular places of a differential operator; 
the <I>regular singular</I> places
and the <I>irregular singular</I> places.
With the notation as above, a singular place (q) of L is regular singular
if the valuation of the coefficient of (tilde(D))<sup>i</sup> in tilde(L) is at most i - n 
for every i&isin;{0, 1, ..., n - 1}.
Otherwise it is irregular singular. 


<H5><A NAME = "14315">IsRegularPlace(L, p) : RngDiffOpElt, PlcFunElt -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> iff the place p is a 
regular place of the differential operator L.
If p is not a regular place of L <TT>false</TT> is returned.
This function only works for operators whose derivation 
is defined by a differential. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14316">IsRegularSingularPlace(L, p) : RngDiffOpElt, PlcFunElt -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> iff the place p is a regular singular 
place of the differential operator L.
If p is not a regular singular place of L <TT>false</TT> is returned.
This function only works for operators whose derivation 
is defined by a differential.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14317">IsIrregularSingularPlace(L, p) : RngDiffOpElt, PlcFunElt -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> iff the place p is an irregular singular 
place of the differential operator L.
If p is not an irregular singular place of L <TT>false</TT> is returned.
This function only works for operators whose derivation 
is defined by a differential.

<H5><A NAME = "14318">SetsOfSingularPlaces(L) : RngDiffOpElt -&gt; SetEnum, SetEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two sets are returned.
The first set contains precisely all regular singular places of the
differential operator L.
The second set consists of all irregular singular places of L.
This function only works for operators whose derivation 
is defined by a differential.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14319">IsFuchsianOperator(L) : RngDiffOpElt -&gt; BoolElt, SetEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> iff the differential operator L
is Fuchsian (i.e. if all singular places of L are regular singular).
If L is not Fuchsian, <TT>false</TT> is returned.
Secondly, the set of all singular places of L, is 
returned only if L is a Fuchsian differential operator.
This function only works for operators whose derivation 
is defined by a differential.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14320">IsRegularSingularOperator(L) : RngDiffOpElt -&gt; BoolElt, SetEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the differential operator L is regular singular.
The operator may be defined over a differential Laurent series ring, F say.
In this case being regular singular means that the operator must be regular 
singular at F.1.
Then also there is no second argument returned.
In the case that the derivation is defined with respect to a differential, then
the values from <TT>IsFuchsianOperator(L)</TT> are returned.

For the definition of a indicial polynomial at a place, we 
refer to Section 4.1 in <A  HREF = "text1296.htm#bib_vdPS03">[vdPS03]</A>.

Returns the monic indicial polynomial of the differential operator L
at the place p.
This function only works for operators whose derivation
