For simplicity, assume A is a modular abelian variety and &pi;:J<sub>0</sub>(N)to A
is the modular parameterization (the case when J<sub>0</sub>(N) is replaced by a more
general modular abelian variety is similar).   The <I>cuspidal subgroup</I>
of J<sub>0</sub>(N) is the finite torsion group generated by all classes of differences
of cusps on X<sub>0</sub>(N).  The <I>cuspidal subgroup</I> of A(Qbar) is the
image under &pi; of the cuspidal subgroup of J<sub>0</sub>(N).  The <I>rational
cuspidal subgroup</I> is the subgroup generated by differences of cusps
that are defined over Q.   (Computation of the rational points
in the cuspidal subgroup has not yet been implemented.)  One important
use of the rational cuspidal subgroup is that it gives a lower bound
on the cardinality (and structure) of the torsion subgroup of
A(Q), which is important in computations involving the Birch
and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture.

Let A be an abelian variety over a number field K.  
Magma can compute upper and lower bounds on the cardinality
of the torsion subgroup of A(K) in the form of a multiple and a divisor
of this cardinality.


<H5><A NAME = "18488">TorsionLowerBound(A) : ModAbVar -&gt;  RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an abelian variety A return a divisor of the cardinality of the 
K-rational torsion subgroup of A(K).  
Currently, to compute a bound we
require that A be the base extension of an abelian variety B over
Q, and the lower bound is simply the cardinality of the rational
cuspidal subgroup of B(Q).

<H5>TorsionMultiple(A, n) : ModAbVar, RngIntElt -&gt;  RngIntElt</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an abelian variety A return 
a multiple of the cardinality of the K-rational torsion subgroup 
of A over K.
If n is not given it is assumed to be 50.
<P>
This multiple is
usually fairly sharp, and is computed as follows.  For each good prime
p &le;n with [K:Q] + 1&lt;p and such that p does not divide the level of A, 
Magma computes #A(k), where k varies over
residue class fields of K of characteristic p.  Since reduction on
torsion is injective for such primes, the greatest common divisor of
the #A(k) is a multiple of the order of the torsion subgroup of
A(K).  Magma computes #A(k) by using Hecke operators to find the
characteristic polynomial of Frobenius on a Tate module of A, and
uses this characteristic polynomial to deduce #A(k). For 
details, see <A  HREF = "text1634.htm#bib_agashe-stein-bsd">[AS05]</A>.
