The category of monoids defined by finite sets of rewrite rules
provide a Magma level interface to Derek Holt's
KBMAG programs, and specifically to KBMAG's Knuth--Bendix completion procedure 
on monoids defined by a finite presentation. As such much of the documentation
in this chapter is taken from the KBMAG 
documentation <A  HREF = "text894.htm#bib_KBMAG">[Hol97]</A>.
Familiarity with
the Knuth--Bendix completion procedure is assumed. Some familiarity with
KBMAG would be beneficial.

A rewrite monoid M is a finitely presented monoid in which equality between
elements of M, called <I>words</I> or <I>strings</I>, is decidable via 
a sequence of rewriting
equations, called <I>reduction relations, rules, or equations</I>. In the
interests of efficiency the reduction rules are codified into a finite state
automaton called a <I>reduction machine</I>. The words
in a rewrite monoid M are ordered, as are the reduction relations of M.
Several possible orderings of words are supported, namely short-lex, 
recursive, weighted short-lex and wreath-product orderings.
A rewrite monoid can be <I>confluent</I> or <I>non-confluent</I>. If a rewrite 
monoid M is confluent its reduction relations, or more specifically its
reduction machine, can be used to reduce words 
in M to their irreducible normal forms under the given ordering, and so the
word problem for M can be efficiently solved.

The family of all rewrite monoids forms a category. The objects are the 
rewrite monoids and the morphisms are monoid homomorphisms. The Magma 
designation for this category of monoids is <A NAME = "MonRWS"><TT>MonRWS</TT></A>. Elements of a
rewrite monoid are designated as <A NAME = "MonRWSElt"><TT>MonRWSElt</TT></A>.

A rewrite monoid M is constructed in a three-step process:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>A free monoid F of the appropriate rank is defined.
<P>
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>A quotient Q of F is created.
<P>
<P>
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD>The Knuth--Bendix completion procedure is applied to the 
monoid Q to produce a monoid M defined by a rewrite system.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
The Knuth--Bendix procedure may or may not succeed. If it fails the user may 
need to perform the above steps several times, manually adjusting 
parameters that control the execution of the Knuth--Bendix procedure.
If it succeeds then the rewrite systems constructed will be confluent.
