Let K be a finite field and let V be the vector space of 
n-tuples over K.  The <I>Hamming-distance</I> between 
elements x and y of V, denoted d(x, y), is defined by
d(x, y) := #{ 1 &le;i &le;n | x<sub>i</sub> != y<sub>i</sub> }.
The <I>minimum distance d</I> for a subset C of V is then
d = min{ d(x, y) | x &isin;C, y &isin;C, x != y }.
The subset C of V is called an <I>(n, M, d) code</I> 
if the minimum distance for the subset C is d and |C| = M. 
Then V is referred to as the <I>ambient space</I> of C.
<P>
<P>
The code C is called a <I>[n, k, d] linear code</I> if 
C is a k-dimensional subspace of V.
Currently Magma supports not only linear codes, but also
codes over finite fields which are only linear over some subfield. These
are known as  <I>additive codes</I> and can be found in Chapter 
<A  HREF = "text1883.htm#20971">ADDITIVE CODES</A>.  
This chapter deals only with linear codes.
<P>
<P>
In this chapter, the
term "code" will refer to a linear code.  Magma provides machinery
for studying linear codes over finite fields F<sub>q</sub>=GF(q), over
the integer residue classes Z<sub>m</sub> = Z/mZ, 
and over galois rings GR(p<sup>n</sup>, k).
<P>
<P>
This chapter describes those functions which are applicable to codes
over F<sub>q</sub>.  The highlights of the facilities provided for such codes
include:

    check matrices and generating polynomials (cyclic codes).
