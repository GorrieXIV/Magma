This section describes the 
two most common sources of confusion encountered 
when using Magma's evaluation strategy.



<H5>Subsections</H5>
<UL>
<LI> <A  HREF = "text66.htm#558">Trap 1</A>
<LI> <A  HREF = "text66.htm#559">Trap 2</A>

We boot Magma. It begins with an initial context something like
<TT>[ ..., ('+',A), ('-',S), ... ]</TT> where A is the (function) value that is the 
addition function, and S is the (function) value that is the subtraction
function.
<P>
Now say we type,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; '+' := '-';
&gt; 1 + 2;
</PRE>
Magma  will respond with the answer <TT>-1</TT>. 
<P>
To see why this is so consider the effect of each line on the current context. 
After the first line the current context will be <TT>[ ..., ('+',S), ('-',S), ... ]</TT>,
where S is as before. The identifier <TT>+</TT> has been re-assigned. Its new value is
the value of the identifier '-' in the current context, and the value of '-' is
the (function) value that is the subtraction function. Hence in the second line 
when Magma  replaces the identifier <TT>+</TT> with its value in the current context, 
the value that is substituted is therefore S, the subtraction function!


<H4><A NAME = "559">Trap 2</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
Say we type,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; f := func&lt; n | n + 1 &gt;;
&gt; g := func&lt; m | m + f(m) &gt;;
</PRE>
After the first line the current context is <TT>[ (f,FUNC( n : n+1)) ]</TT>.
After the second line the current context is <TT>[ (f,FUNC( n : n+1)),
(g,FUNC(m : m + FUNC(n : n+1)(m))) ]</TT>.
<P>
If we now type,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; g(6);
</PRE>
Magma  will respond with the answer 13.
<P>
Now say we decide that our definition of f is wrong. So we now type in
a new definition for f as follows,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; f := func&lt; n | n + 2 &gt;;
</PRE>
If we again type,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; g(6);
</PRE>
Magma  will again reply with the answer 13!
<P>
To see why this is so consider how the current context changes. After typing
in the initial definitions of f and g the current context is <TT>[ (f,
FUNC(n : n+1)), (g, FUNC(m : m + FUNC(n : n+1)(m))) ]</TT>. After typing in the 
second definition of f the current context is <TT>[ (f, FUNC(n : n+2)), 
(g, FUNC(m : m + FUNC(n : n+1)(m)))]</TT>. Remember that changing the <I>value</I> of one 
identifier, in this case f, does <I>not</I> change the value of any other 
identifiers, in this case g! In order to change the value of g to reflect the new 
value of f, g would have to be re-assigned.
