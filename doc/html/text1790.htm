Note that the 
  two functions <TT>UnderlyingGraph</TT> and <TT>UnderlyingDigraph</TT>
  may also be used when one needs to get a copy of a graph G 
  without G's support and vertex/edge decorations.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a graph G, produce a digraph D whose vertex-set is the same as
that of G and whose edge-set consists of the edges of G, each given
a direction. The edges of D are always directed from the
lower numbered vertex to the higher numbered vertex. Thus, if G
contains the edge { u, v }, then D will have the edge
[u, v] if u &lt; v, otherwise the edge [u, v].
The support and vertex/edge decorations of G are not retained.

<H5><A NAME = "19802">UnderlyingGraph(D) : Grph -&gt; GrphUnd</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The underlying graph G of the graph D; 
   G has the same vertex-set as D.
If D is undirected, then G is a copy of D
  without D's support and vertex/edge decorations.
If D is directed, then two vertices u and v are adjacent in G
   if and only if, in D, there is either an edge directed from u to
   v or from v to u.
The support and vertex/edge decorations of G are not retained.

<H5><A NAME = "19803">UnderlyingDigraph(G) : Grph -&gt; GrphDir</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The underlying digraph D of the graph G;
  D has the same vertex-set as G.
If G is directed, then D is a copy of G
  without D's support and vertex/edge decorations.
If G is undirected, then if vertices u and v are adjacent in G
  then, in D, there will be both an edge directed from u to v and
  an edge directed from v to u.
The support and vertex/edge decorations of G are not retained.
