In the following functions, the graph is assumed to be
a directed tree. This means it is a tree containing a root
vertex and all edges are directed away from that vertex.

<H5><A NAME = "19935">IsRootedTree(G) : GrphDir -&gt; BoolElt, GrphVert</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> exactly when the directed graph G is a tree having a vertex v such
that all edges are directed away from v. In this case,
the root vertex v is returned as a second value.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19936">Root(G) : GrphDir -&gt; GrphVert</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The root vertex of a rooted tree.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19937">IsRoot(v) : GrphVert -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the graph containing the vertex 
v is directed as
a rooted tree with v as root.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19938">RootSide(v) : GrphVert -&gt; GrphVert</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
When the graph containing the vertex 
v is directed as a rooted tree,
this returns the unique neighbouring vertex to v which
is closer to the root vertex. If v is the root vertex,
it is returned itself.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19939">VertexPath(u,v) : GrphVert,GrphVert -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A sequence of vertices comprising a path in a directed graph
from the vertex u to the vertex v. The path does not necessarily respect the
edge directions. Indeed it will first trace back to a common
ancestor of u and v and then follow edge directions
to v.
<P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19940">BranchVertexPath(u,v) : GrphVert,GrphVert -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The sequence of vertices on the vertex path from the vertex u to the vertex v
having valency at least 3.
