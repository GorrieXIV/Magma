<LI>The package for working with isolated singularities that
         are analytically isomorphic to a hypersurface singularity has been
         expanded to cover most corank 3 families and more corank 2 families.
         Included are functions for classification, computation of normal
         forms and explicit transformation to normal form following Arnold's
         classification scheme.                                     (V2.21-4)

<LI>Desingularisation by local blow-up, an alternative
         to formal desingularisation,  has been developed for surfaces. It
         is faster than formal desingularisation in certain cases, thereby
         making feasible some computations that were previously impossible.
         Blow-up desingularisation also provides additional information,
         not available with formal desingularisation.               (V2.21-4)

<P>

<LI>Major speedups have been achieved in the main function for formally 
         resolving projective hypersurfaces and in the computations of
         adjoints, and the other algorithms which depend heavily on this.
         In particular, computations over non-trivial number fields have 
         been greatly sped up.

           checking the functional equation, which for L-functions of higher degree
           or weight is now faster and more robust.

          One can also compute with Kummer twists of such motives.
          As with all motivic <I>L</I>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-functions, the capacity to compute the
          Euler factors is a primary necessity. Here a <I>p</I>
<tex2html_verbatim_mark>-adic method is used,
          while a complex method is also available for degree 1 primes.
          These methods also allow a Jacobi sum motive to be identified
          as a Gr&#246;ssencharacter, making Weil's famous theorem effectively computable.
          There is also functionality for basic arithmetic with such motives

<LI>In conjunction with Gael Collinet, and also Markus Kirschmer with his

           lattices over number fields has commenced. Basic functionality such 
           as inner products, sublattices, and orthogonal complements are all 
           available, and rely on the Dedekind module machinery. For totally 
           definite lattices, computing automorphism groups and doing isometry 
           tests are also available, as is enumeration of short vectors.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Similar routines are being developed for Lorentzian lattices, which are
           lattices having one indefinite place. Automorphism groups and isometry 
           between lattices can be determined using the data of a lattice and a 
           timelike vector in it. Future work will be undertaken with the goal of
           performing cohomological computations with such lattices.
