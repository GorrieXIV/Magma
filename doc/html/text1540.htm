The Small Modular Curve database is a database of simple models over the
rational numbers for the X<sub>0</sub>(N) modular curves along with the standard 
automorphisms, cusps and non-cuspidal rational points in the positive
genus cases, the various projection maps from X<sub>0</sub>(N) -&gt; X<sub>0</sub>(M)
when M divides N and expressions for standard functions (j(z), j(Nz))
and forms (e.g. E<sub>4</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>) in terms of rational functions or k-differentials
on the model. We refer to them as "small", because the models are of low
degree, are defined by reasonably sparse polynomials with small integer
coefficients, and are non-singular or have only a few simple singularities.
<P>
Because the Magma type of the model may be <TT>CrvEll</TT>, <TT>CrvHyp</TT>,
<TT>CrvPln</TT> or just general <TT>Crv</TT> and it is not possible for a type
to extend different subtypes of <TT>Crv</TT>, we have not introduced a special
type like <TT>CrvMod</TT> (or used this type) for small modular curves. The
modular curve component of the arguments to most of the intrinsics consists
of a projective curve, which
should be a base change of the model over (Q) to a field of characteristic
zero, and the level N. This is a little "clunky" but hopefully the user
won't find it too awkward. For efficiency, there is currently no initial check
that the curve argument really is a base change of the database model,
which the user can obtain via the <TT>SmallModularCurve</TT> call. The call
will almost certainly result in an error if this is not the case.
<P>
For simplicity, in the initial implementation, the intrinsics require 
the modular curve to be defined over a field of characteristic zero, although
the models are all defined by polynomials with integral coefficients which
reduce nicely for primes not dividing the level. Again, we do not check this
condition in all intrinsics: the user may find that if he carries out a
mod p reduction on the database model himself and uses it as the argument
to some of the intrinsics, they may still work.
