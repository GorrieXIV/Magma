<P>
<P>
The machinery in this section and the next section is for curves defined
over a rational function field k(t) whose field of constants k is finite.
<P>
The Mordell--Weil group can be computed (and generators found) for a curve
y<sup>2</sup> + a<sub>1</sub>xy + a<sub>3</sub>y=x<sup>3</sup> + a<sub>2</sub>x<sup>2</sup> + a<sub>4</sub>x + a<sub>6</sub> where each a<sub>i</sub> is a <I>polynomial</I>
in k[t] &sub;k(t) of degree at most i.
<P>
When this hypothesis is not satisfied, it may still be possible to bound the
Mordell--Weil rank and find Mordell--Weil generators using the 2-descent
routines described in the next section.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These functions return lower and upper bounds (or just an upper bound)
on the rank of the Mordell--Weil group E(F) for an elliptic curve E
defined over a function field F with finite constant field.  The bound
is obtained by applying all the available tools (those described in this
section together with the <TT>AnalyticInformation</TT> obtained from the L-function).

<PRE>    Al: MonStgElt                       Default: "Geometric"</PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This function computes the Mordell--Weil group of an elliptic curve E
that satisfies the hypotheses stated in the introduction immediately above.
The function returns two values: an abelian group A and a map m
from A to E.  The map m provides an isomorphism between the
abstract group A and the Mordell--Weil group.
<P>
The algorithm used by default is the geometric method described above.
However, when <TT>Al</TT> is set to <TT>"Descent"</TT> it instead uses the
2-descent tools described in the next section; if the curve admits
2-isogenies then it uses a separate implementation of descent by 2-isogenies
(described in <A  HREF = "text1454.htm#bib_roberts-phd">[Rob07]</A>).
These descent methods do not always determine the full Mordell--Weil group
(in which case a warning is printed); their advantages are that
they do not require the degrees of the coefficients to be bounded
and in many cases are very efficient.

<H5><A NAME = "16619">MordellWeilLattice(E) : CrvEll[FldFunRat] -&gt; Lat, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This function computes the Mordell--Weil lattice of an elliptic curve E
that satisfies the hypotheses stated in the introduction immediately above.
This is the free part of the Mordell--Weil
group with an inner product given by the N&eacute;ron--Tate height pairing.
The function returns two values: the lattice L and a map m
from L to E.

<H5><A NAME = "16620">GeometricMordellWeilLattice(E) : CrvEll[FldFunRat] -&gt; Lat, Map</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This function computes the geometric Mordell--Weil lattice of an elliptic
curve E that satisfies the hypotheses stated in the introduction
immediately above.
This consists of the free part of the
group of points on E that are defined over the function field with a
possibly extended constant field, together with the N&eacute;ron--Tate pairing.
The function returns two values: a lattice L and a map m
from L to E', where E' is a base change of E over the larger
field.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an elliptic curve E over a rational function field F that
satisfies the  hypotheses stated in the introduction immediately above,
this function returns a sequence of points in E(F) which are
generators of the Mordell--Weil group.

We find that the curve y<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>3</sup> + (t<sup>4</sup> + 2t<sup>2</sup>)x + t<sup>3</sup> + 2t over F<sub>3</sub>(t)
has rank 2 and has no 2-torsion in its Tate--Shafarevich group.
