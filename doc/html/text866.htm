Automatic groups provide a Magma level interface to Derek Holt's
KBMAG programs, and specifically to KBMAG's automatic groups
program <I>autgroup</I>. Much of the material in this chapter 
is based on the KBMAG documentation <A  HREF = "text864.htm#bib_KBMAG">[Hol97]</A>.
Familiarity with the Knuth--Bendix completion procedure and the
automata associated with a short-lex automatic group is assumed. 
Some familiarity with KBMAG would be beneficial.

An automatic group G is a finitely presented group in which various
group operations, notably equality between words of G and word 
enumeration, are decidable through the use of various automata. 
The words in the automatic group G that can be computed in Magma
are ordered using the short-lex ordering on words (shorter words come 
before longer, and for words of equal length lexicographical ordering 
is used, based on the given ordering of the generators).

The family of all automatic groups forms a category. The objects are the 
automatic groups and the morphisms are group homomorphisms. The Magma 
designation for this category of groups is <A NAME = "GrpAtc"><TT>GrpAtc</TT></A>. Elements of a
automatic group are designated as <A NAME = "GrpAtcElt"><TT>GrpAtcElt</TT></A>.

An automatic group G is constructed in a three-step process:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>We construct a free group FG.
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>We construct a quotient F of FG.
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD>We create a monoid presentation for F and then run  
procedures which attempt to construct the automata associated with G 
and to prove them correct. 
<P>

</DL>
These procedures may or may not succeed. Of course, if G is not an 
automatic group then they have no chance of succeeding.
