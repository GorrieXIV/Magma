Letting H<sup> * </sup> denote the extended complex upper half-plane {z &isin;C|Im(z) &gt; 0}&cup;(Q)&cup;&infin;,
X<sub>0</sub>(N)((C)) identifies with the quotient space H<sup> * </sup>/&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N) and the cusps are the images of
(Q)&cup;&infin;. A complete set of representatives of cusps are the images of the points a/d
where d runs through positive divisors of N and, for each d, a runs through a set of integer
representatives of ((Z)/(d, N/d)(Z))<sup> x </sup> relatively prime to d. In particular, if (d, N/d)&le;2,
we just get 1/d. The image of the cusp at &infin; identifies with the image of 1/N.
<P>
With respect to the rational structure of X<sub>0</sub>(N), the cusps are all algebraic points defined over
cyclotomic fields. Specifically, for a given d|N, the a/d are a set of Galois-conjugate points,
each one having (Q)(&mu;<sub>(d, N/d)</sub>) as the field of definition, and the Galois group of
(Q)(&mu;<sub>(d, N/d)</sub>) over (Q) acts simply transitively on this set. In particular, if
(d, N/d)&le;2, the cusp 1/d is a (Q)-rational point on X<sub>0</sub>(N). Thus, &infin;~1/N and
0=0/1~1/1 are always rational cusps.
<P>
The cuspidal points on the models for small modular curves are stored in the database. More precisely,
for each d|N, the database stores either a rational point for the cusp 1/d, if (d, N/d)&le;2, or a cluster
that defines the (Q)-conjugate set of cusps (a/d), if (d, N/d)&gt;2. The user can access these
through an intrinsic. If the model C for X<sub>0</sub>(N) is singular, some cusps may correspond to singular points
on C. There may be two cusps that lie over the same node of C. In any case, the <I>place</I> over each
conjugate class of cusps (a/d) is unique (different for different d) and the database contains information
to determine which place belongs to which cusp for places above a singular cuspidal point on the model.
There is an intrinsic to return the curve place above each (Q)-conjugate set of cusps (a/d).
<P>
Non-cuspidal rational points are of particular interest since they correspond to classes of elliptic curves defined
over (Q) with a cyclic N-isogeny also defined over (Q) up to twist. On the complete set of curves
X<sub>0</sub>(N) of genus &gt; 0, there are very few non-cuspidal rational points and all such were determined by
Mazur and others in the 1970s. The database stores the list of non-cuspidal rational points for each level
N. These are never singular points on the chosen models.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The curve CN should be a base change of the small modular database curve of level N to a field K of characteristic 0.
d is a positive divisor of N. Returns the point on CN corresponding to the cusp 1/d, if (d, N/d)&le;2,
or returns the cluster (zero-dimensional scheme) defined over K that is the reduced subscheme of CN consisting of 
the &phi;((d, N/d)) cusps a/d, if (d, N/d)&gt;2 where &phi; is Euler's totient function.

Returns whether the points lying under the cusps a/d for d|N on the small modular curve database model for X<sub>0</sub>(N)
are singular. For a given d, they either all are or all are not.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The curve CN should be a base change of the small modular database curve of level N to a field K of characteristic 0.
d is a positive divisor of N. Returns the sequence of places of CN that correspond to the &phi;((d, N/d)) cusps
a/d. If (d, N/d)&le;2 or K = (Q) there will only be one place. However, if K is a proper extension of
<B>Q</B>, the (Q)-conjugate cusps a/d may split into several Galois orbits over K.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The curve CN should be a base change of the small modular database curve of level N of genus &gt; 0 to a field K
of characteristic 0.
Returns the sequence of points on CN that correspond to non-cuspidal points in X<sub>0</sub>(N)((Q)). There are
only a small number of N for which this is a non-empty set and the rational points are non-singular ones
on all of our models.
