<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a connected (undirected) graph G, 
construct a spanning tree for G rooted
at an arbitrary vertex of G. 
The spanning tree is returned as a subgraph of G.
The support and vertex/edge decorations are <I>not</I> retained 
  in the resulting (structural) subgraph.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "19931">SpanningForest(G) : Grph -&gt; Grph, GrphVertSet, GrphEdgeSet</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a graph G, construct a spanning forest for G. 
The forest is returned as a subgraph of G.
The support and vertex/edge decorations are <I>not</I> retained 
  in the resulting (structural) subgraph.

<H5><A NAME = "19932">BreadthFirstSearchTree(u) : GrphVert -&gt; Grph, GrphVertSet, GrphEdgeSet</A></H5>
<H5>BFSTree(u) : GrphVert -&gt; Grph</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a vertex u belonging to the graph G, return a
breadth-first search for G rooted at the vertex u.
The tree is returned as a subgraph of G.
The support and vertex/edge decorations are <I>not</I> retained 
  in the resulting (structural) subgraph.
Note that G may be disconnected.

<H5>DFSTree(u) : GrphVert -&gt; Grph, GrphVertSet, GrphEdgeSet, SeqEnum</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a vertex u belonging to the graph G, return a
depth-first search tree T for G rooted at the vertex u.
The tree T is returned as a subgraph of G.
The support and vertex/edge decorations are <I>not</I> retained 
  in the resulting (structural) subgraph.
Note that G may be disconnected.
<P>
The fourth return argument returns, for each vertex u of G,
  the tree order of u, that is, the order in which 
  the vertex u has been visited while performing the 
  depth-first search.
If T does not span G then the vertices of G not in T 
  are given tree order from <TT>Order(T) + 1</TT> to <TT>Order(G)</TT>.
