Lie algebras can be constructed in three different ways in magma:
as structure constant algebras, as Lie matrix algebras, or as finitely presented
algebras.
Most of our functionality is for algebras of finite dimension over a field.
Algorithms designed and 
implemented by de Graaf <A  HREF = "text1058.htm#bib_wdg-lie-alg">[dG00]</A> are available for determining the 
structure of a Lie algebra.  
In particular, if the algebra is reductive, its root 
system and its highest-weight representations can be determined.
<P>
We provide functionality for computing with groups of Lie type (i.e. reductive algebraic groups and their
split (untwisted) groups, given by the Steinberg presentation.
A canonical form for words in this group, and algorithms for computing with these words are given in
<A  HREF = "text1058.htm#bib_CohenMurrayTaylor">[CMT04]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1058.htm#bib_ComputUnipGrps">[CHM08]</A>.
Twisted groups are given by a modified version of this presentation
using Galois cohomology <A  HREF = "text1058.htm#bib_SH">[Hal05]</A>.  
Efficient algorithms have been
implemented for arithmetic with the Steinberg presentation and for converting
between this presentation and matrix representations over the base field.
Note that these presentations are not in the category <TT>GrpFP</TT> since the
generators are parametrised by field elements and so the groups 
involved are not necessarily finitely generated.
<P>
This is described in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1130.htm#12659">LIE ALGEBRAS</A>.
