This chapter describes the semantics of Magma  (how expressions are evaluated,
how identifiers are treated, etc.) in a fairly informal way. Although some
technical language is used (particularly in the opening few sections) the 
chapter should be easy and essential reading for the non-specialist. The 
chapter is descriptive in nature, describing how Magma  works, with little 
attempt to justify why it works the way it does.
As the chapter proceeds, it
becomes more and more precise, so while early sections may gloss over or omit 
things for the sake of simplicity and learnability, full explanations are
provided later.
<P>
It is assumed that the reader is familiar with basic notions like a 
function, an operator, an identifier, a type and so on.
<P>
And now for some buzzwords: Magma  is an imperative, call by value, statically 
scoped, dynamically typed programming language, with an essentially functional 
subset. The remainder of the chapter explains what these terms mean, and why a 
user might want to know about such things.
