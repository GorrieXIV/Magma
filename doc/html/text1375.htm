Splice diagrams are graphs decorated with integer labels at each end of
each edge and a number of arrows, often none at all, attached to each vertex.
They are fully described in <A  HREF = "text1371.htm#bib_eisenbud-neumann">[EN85]</A>.
No description of the meaning of splice diagrams will be given here,
only the functions that Magma has for manipulating them.
(There are two common features of splice diagrams that cannot yet be realised.
First, omitting edge labels which are 1 is common but is not allowed.
Second, and less trivially, arrow weights are not allowed.
<P>
Other data that is also stored with the diagram are vertex multiplicities,
canonical multiplicities, and total linking numbers of vertices.
The distinction between a splice diagram and its underlying directed graph,
as well as that between a splice diagram vertex and its underlying vertex,
is often left implicit.

Splice diagrams are usually created from geometric objects like plane
curve singularities or jacobian pencils.
They can also be built explicitly by hand.
The section on translations between graphs describes functions which
create splice diagrams associated to resolution graphs.


<H5><A NAME = "15347">SpliceDiagram(C,p) : Sch,Pt -&gt; GrphSpl</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The splice diagram of the plane curve singularity of C at the point p.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15348">RegularSpliceDiagram(P) : LinearSys -&gt; GrphSpl</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The regular splice diagram at infinity of the jacobian pencil P.
This diagram is considered to be rooted at vertex 1 corresponding
to the line at infinity of the ambient plane of P.
Its underlying graph is directed away from this root.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15349">MakeSpliceDiagram(g,e,a) : GrphDir,SeqEnum,SeqEnum -&gt; GrphSpl</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A splice diagram on directed graph g.
The edge labels are taken from the sequence e.
The elements of this sequence are sequences of pairs of integers [a, b].
The i-th element of e will be assigned to the i-th edge of g
(in the order returned by <TT>Edges(g)</TT>) with a as the near label
and b as the far label (with respect to the directions of the edges
of g).
The number of arrows at each vertex are taken from the sequence of
integers a.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15350">MakeSpliceDiagram(e,l,a) : SeqEnum,SeqEnum,SeqEnum -&gt; GrphSpl</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The splice diagram described by the data in the sequences e, l, a.
The first two contain sequences of two integers: e is interpreted as
a set of directed edges, the integers appearing in it being the vertex
indices of the resulting graph.
Edge labels are determined by the sequence l as in the previous function.
The number of arrows at each vertex are taken from the sequence of
integers a.

The raw numerical data of a splice diagram is the collection
of labels on its edges and vertices together with data
recovered from the underlying graph.
First we list functions to get hold of this data, and then
some more substantial functions which derive many of the
natural conclusions of this data, linking number, euler
characteristic and so on.
