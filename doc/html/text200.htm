A (right-distributive) <I>nearfield</I> is a set N containing elements
0 and 1 and with binary operations + and <IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> such that
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT></DT><DD><B>NF1:</B> (N, + ) is an abelian group and 0 is its identity element.
Let N<sup> x </sup> denote the set of non-zero elements of N.
<DT></DT><DD><B>NF2:</B> (N<sup> x </sup>, <IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>) is a group and 1 is its identity element.
<DT></DT><DD><B>NF3:</B> a<IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> 0 = 0<IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> a = 0 for all a&isin;N.

A subset S of a nearfield N is a <I>sub-nearfield</I> if (S, + ) and
(S - {0}, <IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>) are groups.  The sub-nearfield <I>generated</I>
by a subset X is the intersection of all sub-nearfields containing X.
The <I>prime field</I> (P)(N) of N is the sub-nearfield generated
by 1.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The inverse of x&isin;N<sup> x </sup> is written x<sup>[ - 1]</sup>. But where no confusion
is possible we write multiplication of nearfield elements x and y as
xy rather than x<IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> y and we write the inverse of x as x<sup> - 1</sup>. (In
the Magma code we use "*" as the symbol for multiplication.)
<P>
If N is a finite nearfield, the prime field of N is a Galois field
GF(p) for some prime p and p is the <I>characteristic</I> of N.
<P>
A nearfield of characteristic p is a vector space over its
prime field and therefore its cardinality is p<sup>n</sup> for some n.
Every field is a nearfield.
<P>
<P>
<P>
If N is a nearfield, the <I>centre</I> of N is the set
<P>
  (Z)(N) = { x &isin;N | xy = yx for all y&isin;N }
<P>
and the <I>kernel</I> of N is the subfield
<P>
  (K)(N) = { x &isin;N | x(y + z) = xy + xz for all
  y, z&isin;N }.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
It is clear that (Z)(N) &sube;(K)(N) but equality need not
hold because, in general, (Z)(N) need not be closed under addition.
Furthermore, the prime field (P)(N) need not be contained in
(Z)(N). However, for the Dickson nearfields (Z)(N) = (K)(N).
<P>
If N is a nearfield, then (Z)(N) = bigcap{ (K)(N)<sup>x</sup> | x &isin;N,  x &ne;0}.

A group G acting on a set &Omega; is <I>sharply doubly transitive</I> if
G is doubly transitive on &Omega; and only the identity element fixes
two points.
<P>
If G is a finite sharply doubly transitive group on &Omega; then
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>1.</DT><DD>The set M consisting of the identity element and the elements of G
without fixed points is an elementary abelian normal subgroup of G of
order p<sup>n</sup> for some n and some prime p.
<DT>2.</DT><DD>Addition and multiplication between elements of &Omega; can be
defined so that &Omega; becomes a nearfield and so that the
group G is isomorphic to the group of all affine transformations
v |-&gt; va + b of &Omega;, where a&isin;&Omega;<sup> x </sup> and b&isin;&Omega;.
<P>
<P>
<P>

</DL>
There is a converse to this theorem, namely if N is a nearfield, the group
of all transformations v |-&gt; va + b acts sharply doubly transitively
on N.
<P>
<P>
<P>
Let F be the prime field of N, regard N as a vector space over F
and define &mu; : N<sup> x </sup> to GL(N) by
v<sup>&mu;(a)</sup> = va.  Then for all a&isin;N<sup> x </sup>, a &ne;1, the linear
transformation &mu;(a) is fixed-point-free.
Furthermore, &mu; defines an isomorphism between the multiplicative group
N<sup> x </sup> and its image in GL(N).
<P>
Suppose that G = H ltimes M is a sharply doubly transitive group of degree
p<sup>n</sup>, as above. The centre of G is trivial and M is a minimal normal
subgroup. Thus if &Omega;' is a minimal permutation representation we may
suppose that it is primitive. Then M is transitive on &Omega;' and since
M is abelian, it acts regularly on &Omega;'.  Thus p<sup>n</sup> is the minimal
degree of a faithful permutation representation of G.
