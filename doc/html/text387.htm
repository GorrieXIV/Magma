<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are a number of verbose flags <TT>s</TT> applying to the functions 
described in this chapter. The flags and their levels <TT>n</TT> are 
mentioned in the descriptions of the functions which use them.
<P>
Note however, that setting the verbose levels may produce
unexpected results since the effective scope of the flags
is a little bit vague. Consider the following example:
<P>

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; SetVerbose("MaximalOrder", 1);
&gt; SetVerbose("Factor", 1);
&gt; L := NumberField(PolynomialRing(Rationals()).1^2-10);

<P>
The first few lines of output are generated, because
the creation of number fields involves a test of irreducibility
for the defining polynomial(s).
<P>
The next group of lines come from the computation of the 
maximal order which is used for the regulator computation.
<P>
In general the amount of output generated increases with the
value supplied. Furthermore, the output corresponding to larger
values gets more and more technical.

<H5><A NAME = "3709">SetKantPrinting(f) : BoolElt -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Kant-style printing means that integers and rational numbers will be printed
as integers and rational numbers. Especially in 
relative extensions this produces easier to read output - but
it is no longer possible to paste the output back into the system again.
Turns Kant-style printing on if f is <TT>true</TT> and off if f is <TT>false</TT>.
