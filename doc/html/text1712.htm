This chapter presents the functions designed for constructing and
computing with incidence geometries and coset geometries.
<P>
We recall the basic definitions and notation in the field of Incidence
Geometry. We refer to the <I>Handbook of Incidence Geometry</I> <A  HREF = "text1710.htm#bib_buekenhout95">[Bue95]</A>, edited
by Francis Buekenhout, or to Antonio Pasini's book <I>Diagram
Geometries</I> <A  HREF = "text1710.htm#bib_pasini94">[Pas94]</A>, for a more detailed overview of the subject.
<P>
Let X and I be two finite sets. Let t : X -&gt; I be a
mapping from X onto I. Let ~ be a reflexive and symmetric
relation such that forall x, y &isin;X, x ~y and t(x) = t(y) =&gt; x = y.  The four-tuple &Gamma;(X, ~, t, I) is what we
call an <I>Incidence Geometry</I> in Magma. Remark that it is not
a geometry in the sense of Buekenhout since we do not impose that every
flag (i.e. clique of the incidence graph) of &Gamma; must be contained
in a chamber (i.e. a clique containing one element of each type). If
the latter condition is satisfied, then an incidence geometry is a
geometry in the sense of Buekenhout.  The set X contains the <I>elements</I> of the geometry, while I is called the set of <I>types</I>.
The function t is called the <I>type function</I> and ~ is called
the <I>incidence relation</I> of &Gamma;. The cardinality of I is the
<I>rank</I> of &Gamma;.
<P>
It is possible to construct incidence geometries from a group and some
of its subgroups using an algorithm first introduced by Jacques Tits in 1962 <A  HREF = "text1710.htm#bib_tits1962">[Tit62]</A>.
Let G be a group and let I be a finite set. Let { G<sub>i</sub>, i &isin;I } be a set of subgroups of G. Define X = { G<sub>i</sub>g, g&isin;G, i&isin;I } to be the set of elements of &Gamma;. Define the
type function as t : X -&gt; I : G<sub>i</sub>g -&gt; i and the
incidence relation as follows: G<sub>i</sub>g ~G<sub>j</sub>h iff G<sub>i</sub>g &cap;G<sub>j</sub>h != emptyset. The subgroups { G<sub>i</sub>, i &isin;I } are called
the <I>maximal parabolic subgroups</I>.
The subgroup &cap;<sub>i&isin;I</sub>G<sub>i</sub> is called the <I>Borel subgroup</I>.
Finally, the subgroups { &cap;_(j&isin;I - {i})G<sub>j</sub> , i &isin;I } are called the <I>minimal parabolic subgroups</I>.
  These geometries are called
<I>Coset Geometries</I> in Magma to remind the user that they are
constructed from a group. Again, a coset geometry is not a geometry in
the sense of Buekenhout. If every flag of the coset geometry is
contained in a chamber, then it is a Buekenhout geometry. We will see
that, using coset geometries, it is easy to build huge incidence
geometries by giving very little data.
<P>
The category names for the incidence geometries and coset geometries are:
