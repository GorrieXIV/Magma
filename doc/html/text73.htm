The above example demonstrates that while the call graph contains some useful
information, it does not afford a particularly usable interface.  The Magma
profiler contains some profile report generators which can be used to study the
call graph in a more intuitive way.
<P>
The reports are all tabular, and have a similar set of columns:
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD><TT>Index</TT>: The numeric identifier for the function in the
vertex list of the call graph.
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD><TT>Name</TT>: The name of the function.  The function name will
be followed by an asterisk if a recursive call was made through it.
<P>
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD><TT>Time</TT>: The time spent in the function; depending on the
report, the meaning might vary slightly.
<P>
<DT>(iv)</DT><DD><TT>Count</TT>: The number of times the function was called;
depending on the report, the meaning might vary slightly.</DL>

Print the list of functions in the call graph, sorted in descending order by
the total number of times they were called.  The <TT>Time</TT> and <TT>Count</TT>
fields of the report give the total time and total number of times the function
was called.  If <TT>Percentage</TT> is true, then the <TT>Time</TT> and <TT>Count</TT>

Given a vertex n in the call graph G, print the list of functions called by
the function n, sorted in descending order by the number of times they were
called by n.  The <TT>Time</TT> and <TT>Count</TT> fields of the report give the
time spent during calls by the function n and the number of times the
function was called by the function n.  If <TT>Percentage</TT> is true, then the
<TT>Time</TT> and <TT>Count</TT> fields represent their values as percentages of the
total value.  If <TT>Max</TT> is set, then the report only displays the
first <TT>Max</TT> entries.

While the internal reports are useful for casual inspection of a profile run,
for detailed examination a text-based interface has serious limitations.
Magma's profiler also supports the generation of HTML reports of the profile
run.  The HTML report can be loaded up in any web browser.  If Javascript is
enabled, then the tables in the report can be dynamically sorted by any field,
by clicking on the column heading you wish to perform a sort with.  Clicking
the column heading multiple times will alternate between ascending and
descending sorts.


<H5><A NAME = "578">ProfileHTMLOutput(G, prefix): GrphDir, MonStgElt -&gt;</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a call graph G, an HTML report is generated using the file prefix
prefix.  The index file of the report will be "prefix.html", and exactly
n additional files will be generated with the given filename prefix, where
n is the number of functions in the call graph.
