 An algorithm of Sam Conlon for determining the degrees of
the ordinary irreducible characters of a soluble group (without
determining the full character table) has been implemented by 
<B>Derek Holt</B> (Warwick).
<P>
 In 2011, <B>Derek Holt</B> (Warwick) and <B>John Cannon</B> 
(Magma) developed a package for computing the projective indecomposable 
KG-modules for a finite group G.
<P>
 The algorithms used in magma for finding the lattice of
submodules and the endomorphism ring of a KG-module (K a finite 
field) were developed by <B>Charles Leedham-Green</B> (QMW, London) 
and <B>Allan Steel</B> (Magma).

 A basic module for defining and computing with simplicial 
complexes was developed by <B>Mikael Johansson</B> (Jena).
<P>
 <B>Nathan Dunfield</B> (Cornell) and <B>William Thurston</B> 
(Cornell) made available their database of the fundamental groups of 
the 10,986 small-volume closed hyperbolic manifolds in the Hodgson-Weeks 
census.

Introduction</H4>
<P>
The Handbook of Magma Functions is the work of many individuals.  It
was based on a similar Handbook written for Cayley in 1990.  Up
until 1997 the Handbook was mainly written by Wieb Bosma, John Cannon
and Allan Steel but in more recent times, as Magma expanded into new
areas of mathematics, additional people became involved. It is not
uncommon for some chapters to comprise contributions from 8 to 10 people.
Because of the complexity and dynamic nature of chapter authorship,
rather than ascribe chapter authors, in the table below we attempt
to list those people who have made <I>significant</I> contributions to
chapters.
<P>
We distinguish between:
<P>
<IMG SRC="closed.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> <B>Principal Author</B>, i.e. one who primarily conceived
the core element(s) of a chapter and who was also responsible for the
writing of a large part of its current content, and
<P>
<IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> <B>Contributing Author</B>, i.e. one who has written a
significant amount of content but who has not had primary
responsibility for chapter design and overall content.
<P>
It should be noted that attribution of a person as an author of a chapter
carries
no implications about the authorship of the associated computer code: for some
chapters it will be true that the author(s) listed for a chapter are also the
authors of the corresponding code, but in many chapters this is either not the
case or only partly true. Some information about code authorship may be found
in the sections <I>Magma Development Team</I> and <I>External Contributors</I>.
<P>
The attributions given below reflect the authorship of the material
comprising the {V version} edition. Since many of the authors have since
moved on to other careers, we have not been able to check that all of the
attributions below are completely correct. We would appreciate hearing
of any omissions.
<P>
In the chapter listing that follows, for each chapter the start of the
list of principal authors (if any) is denoted by <IMG SRC="closed.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> while the
start of the list of contributing authors is denoted by <IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>.
<P>
People who have made minor contributions to one or more chapters are listed
in a general acknowledgement following the chapter listing.
