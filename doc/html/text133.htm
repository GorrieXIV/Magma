In a <I>record</I> several objects can be collected.
The objects in a record are stored in <I>record fields</I>,
and are accessed by using <I>fieldnames</I>.
Records are like tuples (and unlike sets or sequences)
in that the objects need not all be of the same kind.
Though records and tuples are somewhat similar, 
there are several differences too.
The components of tuples are indexed by integers, and every component must
be defined. The fields of records are indexed by fieldnames, and it
is possible for some (or all) of the fields of a record not to be assigned; 
in fact, a field of a record may be assigned or deleted at any time.
A record must be constructed according to a pre-defined <I>record format</I>,
whereas a tuple may be constructed without first giving the Cartesian product 
that is its parent, since Magma can deduce the parent from the tuple.
<P>
In the definition of a record format, each field is given a fieldname.
If the field is also given a parent magma or a category,
then in any record created according to this format,
that field must conform to this requirement. However, if the field is not
given a parent magma or category, there is no restriction on the kinds of
values stored in that field; different records in the format may contain
disparate values in that field. By contrast, every component of a 
Cartesian product is a magma, and the components of all tuples in 
this product must be elements of the corresponding magma.
<P>
Because of the flexibility of records, with respect to whether 
a field is assigned and what kind of value is stored in it, Boolean operators
are not available for comparing records.
