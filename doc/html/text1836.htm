<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a code C with ambient space V over a finite field, return 
a set of coset leaders (vectors of minimal weight in their 
cosets) for C in V as an indexed set of vectors from V. Note that this
function is only applicable when V and C are small.
This function also returns a map from the syndrome space of C into
the coset leaders (mapping a syndrome into its corresponding
coset leader).

We construct a Hamming code C, encode an information word using C,
introduce one error, and then decode by calculating the syndrome of
the "received" vector and applying the CosetLeaders map to the syndrome
to recover the original vector.
<P>
<P>
First we set C to be the third order Hamming Code over the finite field
with two elements.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; C := HammingCode(GF(2), 3);
&gt; C;
[7, 4, 3] Hamming code (r = 3) over GF(2)
Generator matrix:
[1 0 0 0 0 1 1]
[0 1 0 0 1 0 1]
[0 0 1 0 1 1 0]
[0 0 0 1 1 1 1]
</PRE>
Then we set L to be the set of coset leaders of C in its ambient space V
and f to be the map which maps the syndrome of a vector in V to its coset
leader in L.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; L, f := CosetLeaders(C);
&gt; L;
{@
    (0 0 0 0 0 0 0),
    (1 0 0 0 0 0 0),
    (0 1 0 0 0 0 0),
    (0 0 1 0 0 0 0),
    (0 0 0 1 0 0 0),
    (0 0 0 0 1 0 0),
    (0 0 0 0 0 1 0),      
    (0 0 0 0 0 0 1)

Since C has dimension 4, the degree of the information space I of C
is 4.  We set i to be an "information vector" of length 4 in I, and
then encode i using C by setting w to be the product of i by the
generator matrix of C.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; I := InformationSpace(C);
&gt; I;         
Full Vector space of degree 4 over GF(2)
&gt; i := I ! [1, 0, 1, 1];
&gt; w := i * GeneratorMatrix(C);
&gt; w;         
(1 0 1 1 0 1 0)     
</PRE>
Now we set r to be the same as w but with an error in the 7-th coordinate
(so r is the "received vector").
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; r := w;         
&gt; r[7] := 1;
&gt; r;                
(1 0 1 1 0 1 1)        
</PRE>
Finally we let s be the syndrome of r with respect to C, apply f to
s to get the coset leader l, and subtract l from r to get the corrected
vector v.  Finding the coordinates of v with respect to the basis of C
(the rows of the generator matrix of C) gives the original information
vector.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; s := Syndrome(r, C);
&gt; s;
(1 1 1)      
&gt; l := f(s);
&gt; l;    
(0 0 0 0 0 0 1)
&gt; v := r - l;
&gt; v;                     
(1 0 1 1 0 1 0)                 
&gt; res := I ! Coordinates(C, v);
&gt; res;
(1 0 1 1)
