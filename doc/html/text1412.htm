The polynomials of the Cox ring of a toric variety X provide
homogeneous coordinates on X that can be used to define
subschemes of X.
These subschemes are true Magma schemes, and so the usual
scheme machinery works for them. However, there is a substantial
caveat to this for the first version of the toric geometry package:
affine patches have not been installed systematically, and so
scheme machinery that uses affine patches of schemes will not work.

Toric varieties are the natural ambient space for many varieties.
Here we review the example of a trigonal curve from the
Schemes chapter (it is self-contained here).
<P>
First make a curve. (This curve is in fact trigonal---it admits
a 3-to-1 cover of the projective line. Once you've had that
thought, it's actually pretty clear: the defining equation is a cubic
in y. But there's more to it than just being trigonal, as
we will see.)

&gt; Genus(C);

</PRE>
This curve is of general type (that is, its genus is at least 2),
so we can consider the canonical map: that will either be an
embedding or a 2-to-1 map to a projective line.
<P>
We make the canonical map take its image in a toric variety.

All those binomial equations suggest that V lies on a
toric variety embedded in X=P<sup>7</sup>.
We can recover this toric variety and its map to X.

Toric variety of dimension 2
Variables: b[1], b[2], b[3], b[4]
The components of the irrelevant ideal are:
    (b[3], b[2]), (b[4], b[1])
The 2 gradings are:
    0, 1, 1, 0,
    1, 0, 2, 1

It is a well-known consequence of (geometric) Riemann--Roch that
trigonal curves lie on scrolls in their canonical embeddings.
Exactly which scroll is an intrinsic property of the
particular curve: the Maroni invariant of a trigonal curve
can be realised as the twist that occurs in the scroll, in this
case 2 (visible in the last line of output above).
<P>
This makes good sense: the scroll Y has a natural
map to P<sup>1</sup>, and the equation of the curve W
is a cubic in the fibre variables b[2], b[3] so
defines a 3-to-1 cover of the base.
<P>

&gt; I := Saturation(DefiningIdeal(W),IrrelevantIdeal(Y));
&gt; Basis(I);
[
     b[1]^8*b[2]^3 + b[1]*b[3]^3*b[4] + b[2]^3*b[4]^8
]
</PRE>
The need for saturation is already visible in the
equations of V: all those cubics are really
multiples of a single cubic on the scroll by irrelevant
ideals, but written in the coordinates of the projective space.
