The algorithms, functions and syntax for number fields and orders are often 
parallel to those for extensions of function fields of one variable.
<P>
Number fields in Magma are finite extensions of the rational field Q,
or another number field.
Extensions directly over Q are referred to as <I>absolute fields</I>, 
extensions of number fields are called <I>relative fields</I>.
<P>
The <TT>RationalField()</TT> is <I>not</I> a number field in Magma.
A trivial extension is created by <TT>RationalsAsNumberField()</TT>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
A number field is constructed as K = k[t]/(f(t)) where f is an
irreducible polynomial in k[t].  The generator <TT>K.1</TT> is a root of f.
A field may also be constructed as a multivariate quotient
K = k[s<sub>1</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>]/(f<sub>1</sub>(s<sub>1</sub>), ..., f<sub>n</sub>(s<sub>n</sub>))
for univariate f<sub>i</sub> in k[t].  The generators <TT>K.i</TT> are roots of f<sub>i</sub>.
This construction is a shortcut for creating a tower of single extensions.
<P>
Number fields in Magma are abstract: they do not come with a distinguished
embedding into an algebraically closed field.  Embeddings between fields can be
defined by the user, and may also be chosen (once and for all) by functions such
as <TT>IsIsomorphic</TT> and <TT>IsSubfield</TT>.  Crucially, it is possible to create
multiple copies of the field defined by a given polynomial.  Therefore
every extension defined by the user creates a <I>new</I> object in Magma
(unless the user requests otherwise).
<P>
The embeddings of a field into the real and complex numbers are given by 
the <TT>Conjugates</TT> of an element, or by <TT>InfinitePlaces</TT> of a field
(and <TT>Evaluate</TT> to evaluate the embedding corresponding to a place).
See <A  HREF = "text365.htm#3502">Places and Divisors</A>.
<P>
The basis of <TT>K&lt;w&gt;</TT> = k[t]/(f(t)) over its base field k is always
the power basis 1, w, w<sup>2</sup>, ..., w<sup>n - 1</sup> (where the generator <TT>w = K.1</TT>
is a root of f).  The basis of an order in an absolute field is usually in
hermite form with respect to the field basis, however there are exceptions
such as the <TT>LLL</TT> of an order.  The field of fractions of an order always
has the same basis as the order.
<P>
An arbitrary number field can be converted to an absolute extension of Q
using <TT>AbsoluteField</TT>, i.e. this finds a primitive element over Q.
Similarly, a number field defined by multiple polynomials can be converted 
to a field defined by a single polynomial using <A  HREF = "text360.htm#FldNum:SimpleExtension">SimpleExtension</A>.

Notes about relative fields:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>*</DT><DD>Invariants such as <A  HREF = "text360.htm#FldNum:Degree">Degree</A>, <A  HREF = "text360.htm#FldNum:Discriminant">Discriminant</A>, 
    <A  HREF = "text361.htm#FldNum:Norm">Norm</A>, <A  HREF = "text361.htm#FldNum:Trace">Trace</A> are always relative to the base field.
    They have variants of the form <TT>Degree(K, k)</TT> and <TT>AbsoluteDegree</TT>.
<DT>*</DT><DD>Some operations and invariants are implemented only for absolute 
    fields, for instance <TT>ClassGroup</TT>, <TT>UnitGroup</TT> and so on.
<DT>*</DT><DD>Conversions (eg between relative/absolute fields) may be time consuming.
    However the results are stored, so are only computed once.  Applying the 
    resulting maps to elements should be fast.
<P>

</DL>
<I>Warnings:</I>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>*</DT><DD><TT>Discriminant(F)</TT> for a field F returns <TT>Discriminant(DefiningPolynomial(F))</TT>, 
<I>not</I> <TT>Discriminant(MaximalOrder(F))</TT>.
<DT>*</DT><DD>Some functions defined for fields are shortcuts, referring to the maximal order.
For example, <TT>UnitGroup(F)</TT> returns the (finitely generated) unit group of
<TT>MaximalOrder(F)</TT>, <I>not</I> the multiplicative group of F.</DL>
