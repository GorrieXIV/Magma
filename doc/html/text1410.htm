The initial method of expressing some maps between toric varieties
is to derive them from maps between their associated lattices.
These can also then be presented in terms of the variables of the Cox
ring; this is the usual method for describing toric maps between
projective spaces, for instance.
This often results in radical expressions such as
<P>
(u, v) |-&gt; (Sqrt(u), v, vSqrt(u)).
<P>
This example could be describing a map from P<sup>1</sup> to P(1, 2, 3),
for example: it is a `monomial' map which observes the gradings.
In that case, we could represent the same map by
(u, v) |-&gt; (u, uv, u<sup>2</sup>v) or (u, v) |-&gt; (1, v/u, v/u),
or a host of other expressions.
These two expressions have the benefit that they are polynomial or
rational functions in u and v, and so they automatically define
rational maps, but they have disadvantages too: for example,
evaluating the map at the point (0, 1) is not defined for
these expressions, whereas it gives image (1, 0, 1) in the
original radical expression. (Notice that the choice of root
does not matter, as long as it is assumed that the same choice
a = Sqrt(u) is made at each coordinate.)
<P>
More generally, one can define all maps between toric varieties
(not just those arising from maps of lattices) using an appropriate
notion of `rational radical function', defined in terms of the
polynomial Cox coordinates.
This is very common when describing maps between standard projective
spaces: one writes down a sequence of homogeneous polynomials of the
same degree, without demanding that they are monomials.
<P>
The key point is that a rational map between varieties pulls
rational functions (that are defined on the image) back to rational
functions. It is enough to test this on a basis of rational functions.
In the example above, if x, y, z are the coordinates on P(1, 2, 3)
then y/x<sup>2</sup> and z/x<sup>3</sup> form a basis, and these both pull back to
v/u, which is a rational function on P<sup>1</sup>.
<P>
We allow maps to be constructed from maps of the underlying
toric lattices of fans. When displayed, they are described in
these radical polynomial terms.

The rational map between toric varieties X and Y determined
by the map f between their respective toric lattices (that is,
the lattices underlying their respective fans). If the map f is not
specified, it is assumed to be the identity map (and X and Y are assumed
to have the same toric lattice).

v of the toric lattice containing the fan of X; the natural map
from the blowup to X is also returned.

linear system of divisor.

&gt; Y;
Toric variety of dimension 2
Variables: $.1, $.2, $.3
The irrelevant ideal is:
    ($.3, $.2, $.1)

The image variety Y is clearly the weighted projective space P(1, 1, 2).
The map f returned is a map of underlying lattices. We can convert
it into a map of the toric varieties, after which it will be
presented in Cox coordinates.

&gt; F;
A map between toric varieties described by:
