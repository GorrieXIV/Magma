This chapter describes Magma functions for computing
with Coxeter groups. 
A <I>Coxeter system</I> is a group G with 
finite generating set S={s<sub>1</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>}, defined by relations s<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>=1 for
i=1, ..., n and 
<P>
  s<sub>i</sub>s<sub>j</sub>s<sub>i</sub> ... = s<sub>j</sub>s<sub>i</sub>s<sub>j</sub> ... for i, j=1, ..., n with i&lt;j, where each side of this relation has 
length m<sub>ij</sub>&ge;2.  
Traditionally, m<sub>ij</sub>=&infin; signifies that the corresponding relation is
omitted but, for technical reasons, m<sub>ij</sub>=0 is used in Magma instead. 
The group G is called a <I>Coxeter group</I> and S is
called the set of <I>Coxeter generators</I>.  
Since every group in magma has a preferred generating set, no distinction 
is made between a Coxeter system and its Coxeter group.
See <A  HREF = "text1100.htm#bib_BourbakiLie">[Bou68]</A> for more details on the theory of Coxeter groups.
<P>
The <I>rank</I> of the Coxeter system is n=|S|.
A Coxeter system is said to be <I>reducible</I>
if there is a proper subset I of {1, ..., n} such that m<sub>ij</sub>=2
or m<sub>ji</sub>=2 whenever i&isin;I and j&notin;I.  
In this case, G is an (internal) direct product 
of the Coxeter subgroups W<sub>I</sub>=&lt; s<sub>i</sub> | i &isin;I &gt; and
W<sub>I<sup>c</sup></sub>=&lt; s<sub>i</sub> | i &notin;I &gt;.  
Note that an <I>irreducible</I> Coxeter group may still be a nontrivial direct
product of abstract subgroups (for example, W(G<sub>2</sub>) isomorphic to S<sub>2</sub> x S<sub>3</sub>).
Two Coxeter groups are <I>Coxeter isomorphic</I> if there is a
group isomorphism between them which takes Coxeter generators to Coxeter
generators.  In other words, the two groups are the same modulo renumbering of
the generators.
<P>
magma provides three methods for working with Coxeter groups:
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>1. </DT><DD>As a finitely presented group with the standard presentation
given above.  
These groups have type <A NAME = "GrpFPCox"><TT>GrpFPCox</TT></A>.
See Chapter <A  HREF = "text808.htm#9089">FINITELY PRESENTED GROUPS</A> for general functions for finitely presented
groups.
<P>
<DT>2. </DT><DD>As a permutation group acting on the roots of the root system.
Clearly the group must be finite.
These groups have type <A NAME = "GrpPermCox"><TT>GrpPermCox</TT></A>.
See Chapter <A  HREF = "text629.htm#6871">PERMUTATION GROUPS</A> for general functions for permutation
groups.
<P>
<DT>3. </DT><DD>As a reflection group, i.e. a matrix group generated by reflections.
These groups have the same type as general matrix groups (<A  HREF = "text654.htm#GrpMat"> <TT>GrpMat</TT></A>).
They can be distinguished with the <TT>IsReflectionGroup</TT> function.
<P>
</DL>
The first two methods are described in this chapter.
The third is described in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1118.htm#12530">REFLECTION GROUPS</A>.
<P>
A permutation Coxeter group always has an underlying root system or root datum,
and so many commands involving roots also work for these groups.
A finitely presented Coxeter group does not have such an underlying structure.
<P>
The code for Coxeter groups as permutation groups was originally
modelled on the corresponding part of the Chevie package of GAP <A  HREF = "text1100.htm#bib_Chevie">[GHL+96]</A>
by Meinholf Geck, Frank L&uuml;beck, Jean Michel and G&ouml;tz Pfeiffer.

<P>
Every element w of a Coxeter group W can be written as a word
<P>
  w = r<sub>1</sub> r<sub>2</sub> ... r<sub>l</sub>
<P>
with each r<sub>i</sub> in S.  
A <I>reduced expression</I> for w is such a word with l minimal;
in this case, l is defined to be the <I>length</I> of w.
<P>
An ordering on words in S is obtained by taking the <I>lexicographic 
(alphabetic) order</I> induced by the existing ordering on S.
The <I>normal form</I> for w in W is the smallest reduced expression for
w with respect to this ordering.
Algorithms for efficiently computing this normal form have been developed and 
implemented by R. B. Howlett.
These algorithms are based on the concept of a minimal root <A  HREF = "text1100.htm#bib_Brink98">[Bri98]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1100.htm#bib_BrinkHowlett93">[BH93]</A>.
<P>
The main difference of the category of Coxeter groups (<A  HREF = "text1102.htm#GrpFPCox"> <TT>GrpFPCox</TT></A>)
from the category of finitely presented groups (<TT>GrpFP</TT>) is that
that all words are automatically put into this normal form.  
In particular, this means that two words are equal if, and only if, they are
equal as group elements.
Coxeter groups can also be constructed in the category <TT>GrpFP</TT> 
if the user wishes to avoid automatic normalisation of elements (see
Section <A  HREF = "text1104.htm#12346">Converting Between Types of  Coxeter Group</A>).
