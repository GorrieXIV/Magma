A quaternion algebra A over a field K is a central simple algebra 
of dimension four over K, or equivalently when K does not have 
characteristic 2, an algebra generated by elements i, j which satisfy
 i<sup>2</sup>=a,  j<sup>2</sup>=b,  ji= - ij 
with a, b &isin;K<sup> * </sup>.  A quaternion algebra in Magma is a specialized 
type <TT>AlgQuat</TT>, which is a subtype of associative algebra <TT>AlgAss</TT> 
defined over a field.  Magma can recognize if an associative algebra
A is a quaternion algebra and will return a standard representation
for A with a, b as above.
<P>
Examples of quaternion algebras include the ring M<sub>2</sub>(K) of 
2 x 2-matrices over K with a=b=1, as well as the division
ring of Hamiltonians over K=R with a=b= - 1.  Every 
quaternion algebra over a finite field or an algebraically closed
field is isomorphic to M<sub>2</sub>(K).  Over a local field, there is a unique
quaternion algebra (up to isomorphism) which is a division ring.
<P>
Every quaternion algebra A over K not isomorphic to M<sub>2</sub>(K) is a 
division algebra.  Finding a zerodivisor in A is computationally
equivalent to the problem of finding a K-rational point on a conic.
Given a zerodivisor in A, Magma will compute an 
explicit isomorphism A to M<sub>2</sub>(K).  If L is an extension field
of K, then A<sub>L</sub>=A tensor <sub>K</sub> L is a quaternion algebra over L,
and we say L is a <I>splitting field</I> if A<sub>L</sub> isomorphic to M<sub>2</sub>(L).  If 
[L:K]=2, then L is a splitting field if and only if there exists
a K-embedding L -&gt; A, and such an embedding can
be computed in Magma.
<P>
Further functionality is available for quaternion algebras A defined 
over number fields K.  Such an algebra is said to be <I>unramified</I>
at a noncomplex place v of K if K<sub>v</sub> is a splitting field for A, 
otherwise A is <I>ramified</I> at v.
Testing if an algebra is ramified at a place is encoded in the
<I>Hilbert symbol</I>, which can be computed for any such algebra.
The set S of ramified places of an algebra is finite and of even 
cardinality, and conversely, given such a set S there exists a 
quaternion algebra which is ramified only at S.  One may 
compute the set of ramified places of A as well
as constructing an algebra given its ramification set.
<P>
In Magma, there are algorithms for quaternion algebras
which are analogous to those for number fields---computation 
of the ring of integers, class group,
and unit group.  One may compute a maximal order 
O &sub;A, a p-maximal order for a prime p of K, and orders
with given index in a maximal order.  Secondly, a representative 
set of (right) ideal classes in O can be enumerated, and one can
test if two ideals are isomorphic (hence if a given
 ideal is principal).  
Finally, for a definite quaternion algebra (defined over a totally
real field), one may compute the group of units of norm 1 in O.  
Over Q, these functions tie into machinery for constructing 
the Brandt module, with applications to modular forms.
<P>
Orders for quaternion algebras over the rational numbers and over 
rational function fields in Magma 
have type <TT>AlgQuatOrd</TT> and ideals have type <TT>AlgQuatOrdIdl</TT>.
Over other number rings, orders have the general type <TT>AlgAssVOrd</TT>
and ideals <TT>AlgAssVOrdIdl</TT> which is also the type for used
for associative orders.  The types <TT>AlgQuatOrd</TT>, 
<TT>AlgQuatOrdElt</TT> and <TT>AlgQuatOrdIdl</TT>
inherit from the types <TT>AlgAssVOrd</TT>, <TT>AlgAssVOrdElt</TT> and
<TT>AlgAssVOrdIdl</TT> respectively.
<P>
The main reference for material in this chapter is the book of
Vign&eacute;ras <A  HREF = "text981.htm#bib_Vigneras80">[Vig80]</A>. Most nontrivial algorithms for quaternion
algebras over the rationals and over number fields are described in
<A  HREF = "text981.htm#bib_kirschmer-voight">[KV10]</A>.

<B>IMPORTANT WARNING.</B>
<P>
<P>
<P>
In Magma, the rationals are <I>not</I> considered to be a number field 
(the type <TT>FldRat</TT> is not a subtype of <TT>FldNum</TT>). 
Much of the functionality for quaternion algebras, and particularly
for orders in quaternion algebras, is implemented only for algebras
whose base field is a <TT>FldNum</TT> (while some, but not all, also works
for algebras over the <TT>FldRat</TT>). To compute with algebras over 
Q, in many cases the best solution is to create Q as a number field 
at the outset, using <TT>RationalsAsNumberField()</TT>, and create the algebra
over this field instead of <TT>Rationals()</TT>.
