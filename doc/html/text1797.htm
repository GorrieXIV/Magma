Whenever the edges of a graph are assigned a capacity it is possible 
   to compute the maximum flow and the minimum cut of the graph.
Whenever the edges of a graph are assigned a weight it is possible
  to find shortest paths in the graph.
If one wants to perform these computations on a graph
  where none of its edges have been assigned a capacity or a weight,
  then the edges are taken to have a capacity or weight of one, and the
  computations are carried out accordingly.
<P>
The flow-based and shortest-paths algorithms and the resulting 
  functionalities are fully documented in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1809.htm#20036">MULTIGRAPHS</A>,
  Sections <A  HREF = "text1828.htm#20291">Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut</A> and <A  HREF = "text1821.htm#20253">Distances, Shortest Paths and Minimum Weight Trees</A>
  respectively.
