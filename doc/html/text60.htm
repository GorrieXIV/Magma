Before executing a piece of code Magma  attempts to check that it is
semantically well formed (i.e., that it will execute without crashing).
One of the checks Magma  makes is to check that an identifier is declared
(and thus initialized) before it is used in an expression. So, for example
assuming a had not been previously declared, then before executing either 
of the following lines Magma  will raise an error:
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; a;
&gt; b := a;
</PRE>
Magma  can determine that execution of either line will cause an error since
a has no assigned value. The user should be aware that the checks made for 
semantic well-formedness are necessarily not exhaustive!
<P>
There is one important rule concerning uninitialized identifiers and assignment.
Consider the line,
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; a := a;
</PRE>
Now if a had been previously declared then this is re-assignment of a.
If not then it is an error since a on the right hand side of the <TT>:=</TT> has
no value. To catch this kind of error Magma  checks the expression on the right 
hand side of the <TT>:=</TT> for semantic well formedness <I>before</I> it declares the 
identifiers on the left hand side of the <TT>:=</TT>. Put another way the identifiers 
on the left hand side are not considered to be declared in the right hand side,
<I>unless</I> they were declared previously.
