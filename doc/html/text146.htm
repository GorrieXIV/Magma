Rings of various kinds form the richest source of algebraic structures in
Magma. The tables list the most important types.

The list of rings in the table is not exhaustive, for two reasons.
In the first place, some rings have been categorized differently,
because their module structure or algebra structure seems pre-eminent; thus
matrix rings and finitely presented algebras 
are classified in the online help (more or less arbitrarily) as algebras, 
and vector spaces and their generalizations as modules. 
(Also, rings of class functions are described under the node on groups.) 
Furthermore, certain general constructions (such as <TT>sub</TT>) allow the user 
to define rings that do not appear in the above list, most notably
subrings of Z.
<P>
Looking at the table it may seem that all rings in Magma are commutative
and unital. This is not the case (even though it would have made life
much easier); since polynomial rings and the like can be defined over
any coefficient ring, the matrix rings and finitely presented algebras
not listed here that are not generally commutative, allow the construction
of non-commutative rings. Furthermore, the <TT>sub</TT> constructor allows
the creation of rings without 1; certain functions for the construction
of new rings from old ones do not allow such non-unital coefficient
rings.
