<P>
There is one verbose printing variable, called <TT>"LSeries"</TT> that controls
verbose printing for all of the functions in this chapter. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; SetVerbose("LSeries",n);
</PRE>
<P>
It accepts verbosity levels n such that 0&le;n&le;3. The values are as 
follows:
<P>
n=0 is the (default) quiet mode. The functions do not print anything 
apart from loss-of-precision warnings.
<P>
n=1 is possibly the most useful setting. The
sign and the residues of L<sup> * </sup>(s) are printed whenever they are determined
from the functional equation.
<P>
n=2 generates messages that allow the user to keep track of what is currently 
happening. So messages are printed when a new L-function is constructed, 
when coefficients are generated or when expansions of special functions are 
computed.
<P>
n=3 is a "keep-alive" setting that basically informs the user that
the computer has not crashed yet and, yes, something is still happening.
For L-functions of large conductor or very high precision that require
a large number of coefficients, Magma will print a "progress indicator" 
every time 1000 new coefficients are generated and every 5000 terms in the
series computations that test the functional equation or compute the
L-values. (The frequencies 1000 and 5000 are stored in the attributes
<TT>L`vprint_coeffs</TT> and <TT>L`vprint_series</TT> of a variable
<TT>L</TT> of type <TT>LSeries</TT> and may be changed at the user's desire.)
