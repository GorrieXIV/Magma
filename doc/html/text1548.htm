We give an example that combines functionality for small modular curves with Magma's machinery for
curve quotients and elliptic curves to compute the j-invariant of a special class of elliptic curves
over <B>Q</B> up to quadratic twist. This class of curves arose in Wiles' original paper on Fermat's
Last Theorem and the Shimura-Tanayama-Weil (STW) conjecture.

In the Breuil-Conrad-Diamond-Taylor-Wiles proof of the STW conjecture, a couple of special cases
arise that lead to a finite number of classes of elliptic curves up to bar(Q)-isomorphism
that have to be determined and then checked directly for modularity. If E[p] is the p-torsion
subgroup of E considered as a (Gal)(bar(Q)/(Q))-module, these are cases where
E[3] and E[5] are both reducible,
E[3] is reducible and E[5] is irreducible but absolutely reducible as a
(Gal)(bar(Q)/(Q)(Sqrt(5)))-module,
or E[5] is reducible and E[3] is irreducible but absolutely reducible as a
(Gal)(bar(Q)/(Q)(Sqrt( - 3)))-module. The first case corresponds to non-cuspidal rational points 
on X<sub>0</sub>(15) and leads, up to isogeny, to one class of twists with j= - 25/2 as may easily be verified
using the intrinsics here. The second case corresponds
to non-cuspidal rational points on a quotient of X<sub>0</sub>(75) and leads to curves with j=0.
We consider the third case in this example, showing
that, up to isogeny, there is one class (up to quadratic twist) with j-invariant (11/2)<sup>3</sup>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
The curves we want are precisely those that have a cyclic subgroup of order 5 rational over <B>Q</B>
and for which the image of (Gal)(bar(Q)/(Q)) in GL<sub>2</sub>((F)<sub>3</sub>), giving the action on E[3],
is the normaliser of a split Cartan subgroup.
<P>
Curves just satisfying the E[3] condition are classified by non-cuspidal rational points on X<sub>0</sub>(9)/w<sub>9</sub>
that are not the image of a rational point of X<sub>0</sub>(9). Such a point p lifts to a point p<sub>1</sub> on X<sub>0</sub>(9)
defined over some quadratic field K such that p<sub>1</sub><sup>&sigma;</sup> = w<sub>9</sub>(p<sub>1</sub>) where &sigma; is the nontrivial
automorphism of K over <B>Q</B>. If (E, C) is an elliptic curve/K with cyclic subgroup C=&lt; P &gt;
rational over K that is represented by the moduli point p<sub>1</sub>, then E<sub>1</sub>=E/&lt; 3P &gt; can be defined
over <B>Q</B> so that the order 3 subgroups C/&lt; 3P &gt; and (C/&lt; 3P &gt;)<sup>&sigma;</sup> generate
E<sub>1</sub>[3], are rational over K and are swapped by &sigma;.
<P>
In the same way, adding the extra condition that there is a rational subgroup of order 5 leads to curves
classified by non-cuspidal rational points of X<sub>0</sub>(45)/w<sub>9</sub>. These do not lift to rational points because
X<sub>0</sub>(45) has no non-cuspidal rational points. X<sub>0</sub>(45)/w<sub>9</sub> is <B>Q</B>-isogenous to the rank 0 elliptic
curve X<sub>0</sub>(15) so only has finitely many rational points. If p<sub>1</sub> is a lift, the image of p<sub>1</sub>
under the 3-projection map X<sub>0</sub>(45) -&gt; X<sub>0</sub>(5) (z |-&gt; 3z on complex points) is a rational
point that corresponds to the desired curve E<sub>1</sub> (with its cyclic 5-subgroup). We could apply
the 3-projection all the way down to X<sub>0</sub>(1) of course, but it is slightly more efficient to just project
to level 5 and remove duplicate images before computing j-invariants.

E is a minimal model for X<sub>0</sub>(45)/w<sub>9</sub> and prjE is the projection from X<sub>0</sub>(45) to E that takes
the cusp &infin; to the zero point of E. We compute the image of the cusps under prjE so as to
discount these when we find all the rational points on E. Since p and w<sub>9</sub>(p) map to the same point
under prjE, we only need consider cusps up to w<sub>9</sub> equivalence. The non-rational conjugate cusps
&#8723; 1/3 are defined over (Q)(Sqrt( - 3)) and are swapped by w<sub>9</sub>, so map to the same rational
point. The same holds for the cusps &#8723; 1/15.

<P>
E has rank zero, so we can recover all of its rational points using <TT>TorsionSubgroup</TT>.
There are 8 in all, 4 of which are images of cusps. We find the 4 non-cuspidal ones and 
compute the pullbacks of them to X<sub>0</sub>(45). In each case, the pull back is a pair of
conjugate points defined over a quadratic field. It is easiest to work with places here
(and we don't have to worry about the base scheme of prjE). The pullback of 
each point gives a single place corresponding to the two conjugate points.

<P>
We compute the j-invariants of the two images and verify that they
represent isogenous curves under the cyclic 5-isogeny coming from the rational
5-subgroup (i.e. they are images of each other under w<sub>5</sub>).

<P>
Finally, we can use Magma intrinsics to check that the elliptic curves
with these j-invariants actually do satisfy the property that the image of
the action of Galois on 3-torsion is the normaliser of a split Cartan
subgroup (D<sub>8</sub>). As this property remains true for quadratic twists and
is unchanged by images under a rational 5-isogeny, we only need check it
for one curve over <B>Q</B> with one of the j-invariants. We also check
that a minimal twist has conductor 338 from which modularity can be
checked explicitly.
