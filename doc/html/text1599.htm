<P>
<P>
<P>
The functions <TT>Decomposition</TT> and <TT>NewformDecomposition</TT> 
express a space of modular symbols as a direct sum of 
Hecke-stable subspaces.
<P>
In the intrinsics below, the <TT>Proof</TT> parameter affects the
internal characteristic polynomial computations.  If <TT>Proof</TT> is
set to <TT>false</TT> and this causes a characteristic polynomial
computation to fail, then the sum of the dimensions of the spaces
returned by <TT>Decomposition</TT> will be less than the dimension of
<TT>M</TT>.  Thus setting <TT>Proof</TT> equal to <TT>false</TT> is usually
safe.


<H5><A NAME = "17774">Decomposition(M, bound : parameters) : ModSym, RngIntElt -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>

<PRE>    Proof: BoolElt                      Default: <TT>true</TT></PRE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The decomposition of the space of modular symbols M with respect to the Hecke operators T<sub>p</sub>
with p coprime to the level of M and p &le; <TT>bound</TT>.  If <TT>bound</TT> is too small, the constituents of the decomposition are not
guaranteed to be "irreducible", in the sense that they can not be
decomposed further into kernels and images of Hecke operators 
T<sub>p</sub> with p prime to the level of M. 
When <TT>Decomposition</TT> is called, the result is cached, so each
successive call results in a possibly more refined decomposition. 
<P>
<P>
Important Note: In some cases <TT>NewformDecomposition</TT> is
significantly faster than <TT>Decomposition</TT>.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Unsorted decomposition of the space of modular symbols M into factors corresponding to the 
Galois conjugacy classes of newforms of level some divisor of the 
level of M.  We require that <TT>IsCuspidal(M)</TT> is <TT>true</TT>. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "17776">AssociatedNewSpace(M) : ModSym -&gt; ModSym</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The space of modular symbols corresponding to the Galois-conjugacy
class of newforms associated to the space of modular symbols M.  The level of the newforms is
allowed to be a proper divisor of the level of M.  The space M
must have been created using <TT>NewformDecomposition</TT>.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "17777">SortDecomposition(D) : [ModSym] -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sort the sequence D of spaces of modular symbols with respect to
the <TT>lt</TT> comparison operator. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "17778">IsIrreducible(M) : ModSym -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if <TT>Decomposition(M)</TT> has cardinality 1.

The ordering on spaces of modular symbols is determined as follows:
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(1)</DT><DD>This rule applies only if <TT>NewformDecomposition</TT> was used 
to construct both of M<sub>1</sub> and M<sub>2</sub>: 
If <TT>Level(AssociatedNewSpace(M1))</TT> is not equal to 
that of M2 then the M<sub>i</sub> with
larger associated level is first.  
<P>
<DT>(2)</DT><DD>The smaller dimension is first.
<P>
<DT>(3)</DT><DD>The following applies when the weight is 2 and the 
    character is trivial:
    Order by W<sub>q</sub> eigenvalues, starting with the <I>smallest</I> 
    p | N, with the eigenvalue +1 being less than the 
    eigenvalue -1.
<P>
<DT>(4)</DT><DD>Order by abs((trace)(a<sub>p</sub>)), with p not dividing the 
    level, and with positive trace being smaller in the 
    event that the two absolute values are equal.
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
Rule (3) is included so that our ordering extends the one used
in (most of!) <A  HREF = "text1591.htm#bib_cremona-algs">[Cre97]</A>.

of weight 2 and level 37.

The above decomposition uses all of the Hecke operator; it suggests
that the decomposition <TT>D</TT> is not as fine as possible.  Indeed,
<TT>D[7]</TT> breaks up further:

&gt; Decomposition(D[7],11);

<P>
The function <TT>AssociatedNewSpace</TT> allows us to see where each of
these subspace comes from.  By definition they each arise by taking
images under the degeneracy maps from a single Galois-conjugacy class
of newforms of <I>some</I> level dividing 90.
