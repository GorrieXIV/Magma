Let A be an algebra over a field K and
let M be a vector space over K. We say that M is a
<I>(right)  A-module</I> if for each a &isin;A and m &isin;M,
a product ma &isin;M is defined such that
 (m + n)a = ma + na, m(a + b) = ma + mb,
m(ab) = (ma)b, m1 = m,
m(ka) = (ma)k = (mk)a,
for all a, b &isin;A, m, n &isin;M, k &isin;K.
<P>
Recall that a <I>representation</I> of an algebra A
over a field K is an algebra homomorphism of 
A into  Hom<sub>K</sub>(M, M), for some K-module M.  Taking M 
to be an A-module, and defining a mapping &rho;: M -&gt; M by
&rho;(m) := ma  (a &isin;A, m &isin;M)
then it is an easy exercise to show that &rho; is a
representation of A.  A <I>matrix representation of 
degree n</I> of the algebra A is an algebra homomorphism 
of A into  M<sub>n</sub>(K), the complete matrix algebra of degree 
n over K.  Suppose M has finite K-dimension n and choose a
basis for M. 
If, for each a &isin;A, we associate the matrix corresponding to 
the action of a on the basis elements, we obtain a 
matrix representation of A. Thus, each A-module of finite K-dimension
<I>affords</I>
a matrix representation of the algebra A.
An important special case occurs when A=K[G], the group algebra
of a group G. In this case the theory of A-modules
coincides with the theory of group representations. 
<P>
Throughout this chapter we shall use the term <I>A-module</I> 
when referring to modules as defined above.  For Magma V version,
A-modules are restricted to one of the following cases:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>A matrix algebra A defined over a field.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>A matrix algebra A defined  over a field corresponding to a
representation of a group G of finite degree. In this case the user 
is (implicitly) computing with the group algebra K[G].
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD>A matrix algebra A defined over an Euclidean Domain R. 
However, as currently the action of A may be used only in the 
construction of submodules, discussion will be limited to the case 
in which the coefficient ring is a field.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
Note that in all of the above cases A has finite K-dimension.

Magma provides a range of facilities for defining and computing 
with A-modules. In particular, extensive machinery is provided
for creating K[G]-modules which is described in the following
chapter. It should be noted however, that many advanced functions 
only apply when A is an algebra over a finite field.  Since the 
R-module of n-tuples, R<sup>(n)</sup>, underlies an A-module, the 
operations for R<sup>(n)</sup> are also applicable.
