The concept of a linear codes over a finite field (see Chapter 
<A  HREF = "text1831.htm#20301">LINEAR CODES OVER FINITE FIELDS</A>) can be generalized to the notion of an <I>additive</I> 
code. Given a finite field F and the space of all n-tuples of F, 
an additive code is a subset of F<sup>(n)</sup> which is a K-linear subspace 
for some subfield K &sube;F.
<P>

Additive codes have become increasingly important recently due to their 
application to the construction of quantum error-correcting codes, though 
they are also of interest in their own right.  A Magma package for 
quantum error-correcting codes is built on the machinery for additive
codes.
<P>
<P>
In Magma an additive code has both an <I>alphabet</I> F and a 
<I>coefficient field</I> K, which is a subfield of F.
An error-correcting code is considered to be defined by its wordset,
so there may be several different ways of presenting a given code using
different coefficient fields.
<P>
<P>
Since a given code may be presented over different coefficient rings, 
the <I>dimension</I> k of an additive code is defined relative to the
alphabet of the code, #C = (#F)<sup>k</sup>, leading to possibility of 
<I>fractional</I> dimensions.  Consequently, the number of generators of 
an additive code will not equal its dimension, there being [F:K] times
as many generators. So a length n K-additive code over F has between
zero and n * [F:K] generators.
<P>
<P>
For example, consider the two length 3 vectors over F<sub>4</sub>:
(1, 0, &omega;<sup>2</sup>), (0, &omega;, 0).
The linear code generated by these vectors consists of all scalar 
multiples and sums, resulting in a total of 4<sup>2</sup> = 16 vectors. 
But the F<sub>2</sub>-additive code generated by these two
vectors contains <I>only their sums</I>, resulting in a
total of 2<sup>2</sup> = 4 vectors. These vectors are
(0, 0, 0), (1, 0, &omega;<sup>2</sup>), (0, &omega;, 0), (1, &omega;, &omega;<sup>2</sup>).
The alphabet of this code is F<sub>4</sub>, its coefficient field is F<sub>2</sub>, it
has 2 generators and is of dimension 1.
<P>
<P>
<P>
A length n, dimension k K-additive code over F
with k<sub>g</sub> generators is represented in Magma as an [n, k : k<sub>g</sub>] 
K-additive code over F.
The concepts of weight, distance and their respective distributions
and enumerators transfer directly from linear codes. An
[n, k : k<sub>g</sub>, d] K-additive code 
over F is a K-linear subset of F<sup>(n)</sup>
which has fractional dimension k, k<sub>g</sub> generators and a minimum weight
of d.
<P>
<P>
As a general rule, additive and linear codes may be used interchangeably.
Indeed any linear code can be expressed as an additive code, using
either its alphabet or any subfield as its coefficient field.
So any linear code over a finite field, of type <TT>CodeLinFld</TT>, is
in fact also an additive code, of type <TT>CodeAdd</TT>.
The theory of purely linear codes is more general than that of additive 
codes so unfortunately not all operations are transferable.
