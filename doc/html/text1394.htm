This section describes intrinsics that construct K3 surfaces.
It also describes a few intrinsics that can be used to study them,
but see Section <A  HREF = "text1392.htm#15615">Generic Polarised Varieties</A> for the general intrinsics that
apply to all polarised varieties.
<P>
The calculations are based on Alt{i}nok's Riemann--Roch formula
<A  HREF = "text1387.htm#bib_altinok">[Alt98]</A> for polarised K3 surfaces with Du Val singularities.

The basic RR data from which a K3 surface can be created comprises 
an integer, the <I>genus</I>, g &ge; - 1 and a basket of (Gorenstein 
surface) point singularities B.  The basket B can be created 
explicitly as a basket using the functions of Section <A  HREF = "text1400.htm#15721">Making New Databases</A>, 
but a convenient shortcut is provided whereby the basket argument 
may be given `in raw basket format', that is, as a sequence B of 
length two sequences, each of the form [r, a], denoting the 
singularity oneover(r)(a, r - a).

<H5>K3Surface(g,B) : RngIntElt,SeqEnum -&gt; GRK3</H5>

Sometimes it is desirable to add or remove weights from a given
K3 surface.  There are two intrinsics that allow this to be done
(and check that a weight really can be removed).  These intrinsics
are used systematically in the construction of the K3 database.


<H5><A NAME = "15657">IncludeWeight(X,w) : GRK3,RngIntElt -&gt; GRK3</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return a new K3 surface that is the same as X but with
the positive integer w included among the weights
and all other data associated to the embedding
adjusted as required.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15658">RemoveWeight(X,w) : GRK3,RngIntElt -&gt; GRK3</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return a new K3 surface that is the same as X but with the positive 
integer w removed from the weights, assuming it appears there and 
can be removed without destroying the property of the Hilbert numerator
being a polynomial. All other data associated to the embedding is
adjusted as required.
