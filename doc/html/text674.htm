If a matrix group G is defined over a finite field then, provided that the
group is not too large, we can construct a BSGS-representation for
G and consequently apply the standard algorithms for group structure as
described in Chapter <A  HREF = "text653.htm#7392">MATRIX GROUPS OVER GENERAL RINGS</A>.  However, there are many
examples of groups having moderately small dimension where we cannot find
a BSGS-representation.  
<P>
In this chapter we describe techniques for
computing with matrix groups that do not assume that a
BSGS-representation is available. Thus, the techniques described here
apply to matrix groups possibly having much larger order or much
larger dimension than those that can be handled with the techniques of 
Chapter <A  HREF = "text653.htm#7392">MATRIX GROUPS OVER GENERAL RINGS</A>.
<P>
The <TT>CompositionTree</TT> package introduced in
Section <A  HREF = "text679.htm#7815">Composition Trees for Matrix  Groups</A>,
which includes the collection of LMG (large matrix group) functions
described in Section <A  HREF = "text680.htm#7838">The LMG functions</A>, provides a framework
for such investigations.  The package was prepared by
Henrik B&auml;&auml;rnhielm, Derek Holt, C.R. Leedham-Green and E.A. O'Brien,
and includes code developed by Peter Brooksbank, Elliot Costi, Kenneth Clarkson,
Heiko Dietrich, Alice Niemeyer, and Csaba Schneider.  
<P>
For recent surveys of work in this area, we refer the reader to

The techniques described in this chapter 
fall roughly into two categories. 
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(a)</DT><DD>Functions based on Aschbacher's theorem classifying 
maximal subgroups of the general linear group.  The main thrust of 
this work is to devise a framework for computing arbitrary structural 
information for a matrix group without the use of a BSGS-representation.
<P>
<DT>(b)</DT><DD>Functions which employ Monte Carlo and Las Vegas algorithms
to determine some property of the group.</DL>
