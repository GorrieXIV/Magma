Let R=K[V]<sup>G</sup> be the invariant ring of a finite group G over the field K and
suppose the degree of G is n.  Suppose also that primary invariants
{ f<sub>1</sub>, ..., f<sub>n</sub> } for R have been constructed, together with
minimal secondary invariants S = { g<sub>1</sub>, ..., g<sub>m</sub> } for R with respect
to these primary invariants.  Suppose also that the
irreducible secondary invariants for R are S = { h<sub>1</sub>, ..., h<sub>r</sub> } so
that the g<sub>i</sub> are power products of the h<sub>i</sub>.  We write g<sub>i</sub>=p<sub>i</sub>(h<sub>i</sub>)
where the p<sub>i</sub> are monomials of the indeterminates t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>r</sub>.
Then R is generated as an algebra over K by the primary invariants
f<sub>1</sub>, ..., f<sub>n</sub> and the irreducible secondary invariants h<sub>1</sub>, ..., h<sub>r</sub>.
Magma allows the construction of a polynomial algebra A with
indeterminate names <TT>"f1"</TT>, <TT>"f2"</TT>, etc. corresponding to the
primary invariants and indeterminate names <TT>"h1"</TT>, <TT>"h2"</TT>,
etc. corresponding to the irreducible secondary invariants.  Thus
R can be regarded as an homomorphic image of A and finding the
algebraic relations between these (algebra) generators of R yields a
presentation of R as a quotient of a polynomial algebra.
The functions in this section
construct the algebra A and the algebraic relations for R.
When creating the algebra A, the algebra A is assigned
the print names <TT>"f1", "f2", "h1", "h2"</TT>, etc. -- the angle
bracket notation or the . operator should be used to assign the variables
of A to actual Magma variables.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>, return the
polynomial algebra A=K[f<sub>1</sub>, ..., f<sub>n</sub>, h<sub>1</sub>, ..., h<sub>r</sub>]
of which R is an homomorphic image.  This function
also returns a sequence Q giving the secondary invariants in terms of the
irreducible secondary invariants as monomials in A.  Thus
Q[i] is the monomial p<sub>i</sub>(t<sub>i</sub>) mentioned in the introduction to
this section.  Note that the secondary invariant 1 is <I>not</I>
an irreducible secondary invariant so no h-variable corresponds to
it (the polynomial 1 in A simply corresponds to it).

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>, return a (sorted) sequence
L giving the algebraic relations amongst the algebra generators
of R as elements of the algebra A corresponding to R.  Thus
R is isomorphic as an algebra (or ring) to the quotient of A
by the ideal of A generated by the relations in L.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>, return the ideal of algebraic
relations corresponding to R.  This is simply the same as taking
the ideal generated by the algebra A by the sequence L returned
by the function <TT>Relations(R)</TT>.

Given an invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>, return the algebra corresponding
to the primary invariants of R as a graded polynomial ring (with
the weights corresponding to the degrees of the primary invariants).

the primary invariants of R (this is stored in R).

We create the invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup> where G is a degree-6 permutation
representation of the direct product C<sub>3</sub> x C<sub>3</sub> of two cyclic groups
both of order 3 and K is the rational field.
We construct the algebra A and the sequence Q giving the secondary
invariants in terms of the irreducible secondary invariants.
We then note that the degree-6 secondary invariant is obtained
as the product of two degree-3 irreducible secondary invariants.
We then construct the list L of algebraic relations in A for R.
Thus R is isomorphic to the quotient ring A/&lt;L&gt;.
We then construct an homomorphism h from A onto R and check that
the relations in L are correct.
Finally, we check that the Hilbert series of the (quotient by the)
ideal of A generated by L is the same as the Hilbert series of R
as expected.
