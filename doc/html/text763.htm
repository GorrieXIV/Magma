Magma provides facilities for constructing and working with 
automorphism groups of various objects. In this chapter we describe 
the machinery provided in Magma for groups of automorphisms in 
the case of groups.

An <I>automorphism</I> of a group G is a bijective homomorphism from 
G to itself. The set of all automorphisms of G forms a group U
known as the <I>automorphism group</I> of G. A subgroup A of U 
will be referred to as a <I>group of automorphisms</I> of G.  The group 
G is called the <I>base group</I> of a group of automorphisms A and 
we say that A acts on G. Each Magma automorphism group A stores, 
as part of its data structure, a generating set for its base group, and 
each automorphism of A is described by its action on these generators.

The full group of automorphisms may be found using an algorithm that
proceeds as follows: A series of characteristic subgroups 
       1 = N<sub>r</sub> &lt; N<sub>r - 1</sub> &lt; ... &lt; N<sub>1</sub>=L &lt; G 
is constructed for the given group G, such that each N<sub>i</sub>/N<sub>i + 1</sub>
is elementary abelian and such that G/L has no non-trivial soluble
normal subgroup.  The automorphism group is found for each of the
associated factor groups of G, starting with the top factor G/L
and lifting through each layer N<sub>i</sub>/N<sub>i + 1</sub> in turn, until we finally
have the automorphism group for G itself.  The general algorithm for
a non-soluble group is described in Cannon and Holt <A  HREF = "text761.htm#bib_autos-permg">[CH03]</A>.
More specialised versions are described by Eick, Leedham-Green and 
O'Brien <A  HREF = "text761.htm#bib_elo-auts">[ELGO02]</A> (p-groups) and Smith <A  HREF = "text761.htm#bib_smith-thesis">[Smi94]</A>
(soluble groups). This general class of algorithms will be referred
to collectively as <I>lifting algorithms</I>.

When G is a non-soluble permutation or matrix group, the algorithm
relies on a database of automorphism groups for the non-cyclic simple
factors of G, hence the non-abelian composition factors of G
must belong to a restricted list. In V2.20 this list includes all
simple groups of order at most 1.6times10<sup>7</sup>, the alternating groups
of degree at most 2499, 
L<sub>2</sub>(q), L<sub>3</sub>(q), L<sub>4</sub>(q), L<sub>5</sub>(q), L<sub>6</sub>(q) and L<sub>7</sub>(q) for all q,
U<sub>3</sub>(q) for all q,
U<sub>4</sub>(q) for all q,
S<sub>4</sub>(q) for all q, 
L<sub>d</sub>(2) for d &le;14, and the following groups:
U<sub>5</sub>(3), U<sub>6</sub>(2), U<sub>7</sub>(2), U<sub>8</sub>(2),
S<sub>6</sub>(3), S<sub>6</sub>(4), S<sub>6</sub>(5), S<sub>8</sub>(2), S<sub>8</sub>(3), S<sub>10</sub>(2), S<sub>12</sub>(2), 
O<sup>&#8723;</sup><sub>8</sub>(2), O<sup>&#8723;</sup><sub>8</sub>(3), O<sup>&#8723;</sup><sub>8</sub>(4), O<sup>&#8723;</sup><sub>10</sub>(2), O<sup>&#8723;</sup><sub>12</sub>(2),
O<sub>7</sub>(3), O<sub>7</sub>(5), O<sub>9</sub>(3), 
G<sub>2</sub>(4), G<sub>2</sub>(5), ()<sup>3</sup>D<sub>4</sub>(2), ()<sup>2</sup>F<sub>4</sub>(2)',
Co<sub>2</sub>, Co<sub>3</sub>, He, Fi<sub>22</sub>, Ru, Suz, ON.
The list is being extended regularly.

An automorphism group A of G is represented as a set of homomorphisms
of G into itself. We shall refer to this as the mappings representation 
of A. The full automorphism group is also returned as a finitely 
presented group and, in addition, it is also possible to construct a 
permutation representation of the automorphism.

The family of all groups of automorphisms forms a category.  The 
objects are the automorphism groups and the morphisms are group 
homomorphisms.  The Magma designation for this category of 
automorphism groups is <A NAME = "GrpAuto"><TT>GrpAuto</TT></A>.
