<P>
This chapter deals with curves of genus one that are
given by equations in a particular form. Most of the
functionality involves invariant theory of these models
and applications of this theory to arithmetic problems concerning
genus one curves over number fields.
<P>
Geometrically (viewed over an algebraically closed field),
a genus one model of degree n is an elliptic curve
embedded in P<sup>n - 1</sup> via the linear system |n.O|.
In general, a genus one model of degree n is a principal homogeneous
space for an elliptic curve (of order n in the WeilChat group)
which is embedded in P<sup>n - 1</sup> in an analogous way. Such models are
sometimes called genus one normal curves. Not every
element of order n in the WeilChat group admits such
an embedding, although it does if it is everywhere locally soluble.
<P>
Genus one models may be defined in Magma over any ring. The degree
n can be 2, 3, 4, or 5. Genus one models have their own type
in Magma: <TT>ModelG1</TT>, which is not a subtype of any other
type. In particular, these objects are not curves or even schemes.
The data that defines a genus one model is one of: a multivariate
polynomial (for degree 2 or 3), a pair of multivariate
polynomials (degree 4), or a matrix of linear forms (degree 5).
Each of these are now described in detail.
<P>
A genus one model of degree 2 in Magma is defined either by a binary
quartic g(x, z) (referred to as a model without cross terms),
or more generally by an equation y<sup>2</sup> + f(x, z) y - g(x, z)
where f and g are homogeneous of degrees 2 and 4 and the variables
x, z, y are assigned weights 1, 1, 2 respectively.
A binary quartic g(x, z) defines the same model as the equation
y<sup>2</sup> - g(x, z).  (The implicit map is the projection to P<sup>1</sup><sub>x, z</sub>,
which in this case is not an embedding but rather has degree 2.)
<P>
A genus one model of degree 3 in Magma is defined by a
cubic form in 3 variables
(in other words, the equation of a projective plane cubic curve).
<P>
A genus one model of degree 4 in Magma is defined by
a sequence of two homogeneous polynomials of degree 2 in 4
variables. This represents an intersection of two quadric
forms in P<sup>3</sup>, and is the standard form in which Magma
returns curves that are obtained by doing <TT>FourDescent</TT> on an
elliptic curve.
<P>
A genus one model of degree 5 in Magma is defined by a
5 x 5 alternating matrix
whose entries are linear forms in 5 variables.
The associated subscheme of P<sup>4</sup> is cut out
by the 4 x 4 Pfaffians of the matrix. It is known that every
genus one normal curve of degree 5 arises in this way.
<P>
<I>Note:</I> Degenerate cases are allowed,
which means that the scheme associated to a genus one model is
not always a smooth curve of genus 1 (or even a curve).
<P>
Some related functionality, dealing with models of degree 3,
is described in Section <A  HREF = "text1452.htm#16554">Three-Descent and Five-Descent</A>.
