<P>
<P>
<P>
In this section we describe each of the <B>module monomial orders</B>
available in Magma.  If the user wishes to work with reduced
modules only (particularly for homology computations), then the
underlying monomial orders and Gr&ouml;bner bases will probably be
rarely of interest
to the user, so this section may be skipped.  The monomial orders are
mostly of interest if one wishes to work with
embedded modules with special orders so that the relevant
Gr&ouml;bner bases have special properties. In either case, elements of
the module are represented by vectors in an ambient and we refer to
the vector component positions as <I>columns</I> in analogy to matrix
terminology: a presentational module is often just defined by a
matrix of relations, the rows giving vectors generating the relation
module and the column numbering labelling the components of the vectors.
For our modules there can be a non-trivial column weighting, which we
think of as applying a shift to the degree of a homogeneous polynomial
that occurs as the corresponding vector component of the module element.
This is used to define homogeneity and degree of the overall vector. 
<P>
Given an R-module M, suppose that
the underlying monomial order of R is &lt;<sub>R</sub>.
A <B>module monomial</B> of M is a monomial-column pair consisting of
a monomial
s of R and a column number c (with c &ge;1), written as s[c]
in the following. Monomial-column pairs give an (infinite) basis for
the elements in a free module R<sup>k</sup> and a vector representing an 
element of M can be decomposed into a sum of scalar multiples of
monomial-column pairs just as elements of the polynomial ring R
can be written as a sum of scalar multiples of plain monomials.
<P>
Now suppose that s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] and s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] are module monomials from M.
Any order on the pairs is then fully defined by just specifying exactly
when s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] with respect to that order.
As for multivariate polynomial rings,
in the following the argument(s) are described
for an order as a list of expressions; that means that the expressions
(without the parentheses) should be appended to any base arguments when
any particular intrinsic function is called which expects a module
monomial order.
See <A  HREF = "text1253.htm#bib_AdamsLoustaunau">[AL94, Sec. 3.5]</A> and <A  HREF = "text1253.htm#bib_UAG_CLO">[CLO98, Def. 2.4]</A>
for motivation and further discussion.

Definition: s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] iff s<sub>1</sub> &lt;<sub>R</sub> s<sub>2</sub> or s<sub>1</sub> = s<sub>2</sub> and
c<sub>2</sub> &gt; c<sub>1</sub>.  The order is specified by the argument (<TT>"top"</TT>).
<P>
This order is called "TOP" (term over position) since it first compares
the underlying monomials (terms with the coefficients
ignored [Some authors apply the terms `monomial' and `term'
in opposite senses to how we do here, so that is
why there are the established names `TOP' and `POT'; we follow this instead
of using `MOP' and `POM'!]) and then compares the columns (the positions).
The column comparison is ordered so that the first column is the greatest.
A Gr&ouml;bner basis of a module with respect to the <TT>TOP</TT> order is usually
the easiest to compute, and corresponds to the <TT>grevlex</TT> order for
polynomial rings in a certain way (i.e., the order favours the `size'
of monomials and only gives priority to the columns in a secondary way).


<H4><A NAME = "13786">Term Over Position (Weighted): <TT>TOPW</TT></A></H4>

<P>
<P>
Definition
(given a sequence W of k integer weights, where k is the
degree of the ambient module): write d<sub>i</sub> = Degree<sub>W</sub>(s<sub>i</sub>[c<sub>i</sub>])=
Degree(s<sub>i</sub>) + W[c<sub>i</sub>]; then
s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] iff d<sub>1</sub>&lt;d<sub>2</sub> or d<sub>1</sub>=d<sub>2</sub> and
s<sub>1</sub> &lt;<sub>R</sub> s<sub>2</sub> or d<sub>1</sub>=d<sub>2</sub>, s<sub>1</sub> = s<sub>2</sub> and
c<sub>2</sub> &gt; c<sub>1</sub>.  The order is specified by the arguments (<TT>"topw", W</TT>).
The weights need not be positive (but must be small integers).
<P>
This order first compares the degrees of the monomial-coefficient pairs
using both the weights of the underlying ring R and the weights on
the columns given by W and then proceeds as for the <TT>TOP</TT> order.
If there is a natural grading W on the columns of the module, then
it is preferable to use this order with W, particularly if submodules
of interest are homogeneous or graded w.r.t. W, since then the GB
w.r.t. this order will tend to be smaller and easier to compute.
Normally one would also make the base order &lt;<sub>R</sub> to be
one of the <TT>grevlex</TT> or <TT>grevlexw</TT> degree orders (see
Subsections <A  HREF = "text1205.htm#13443">Graded Reverse Lexicographical:  <TT>grevlex</TT></A>, <A  HREF = "text1205.htm#13443">Graded Reverse Lexicographical:  <TT>grevlex</TT></A>), so that the order
&lt; extends the degree order &lt;<sub>R</sub> to a degree order on the module.

Definition: s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] iff
c<sub>2</sub> &gt; c<sub>1</sub> or c<sub>1</sub> = c<sub>2</sub> and s<sub>1</sub> &lt;<sub>R</sub> s<sub>2</sub>.
The order is specified by the argument (<TT>"pot"</TT>).
<P>
This order is called "POT" (position over term) since it first compares
the columns and then compares the underlying monomials.
The column comparison is ordered so that the first column is the greatest.
A Gr&ouml;bner basis of a module with respect to the <TT>POT</TT> order is 
like an echelon form of a matrix, since the order gives priority
to the columns but this is in general rather harder to compute than
the GB w.r.t. the <TT>TOP</TT> order.


<H4><A NAME = "13788">Position Over Term (Permutation): <TT>POT-PERM</TT></A></H4>

<P>
<P>
Definition (given a sequence P of k integers describing a permutation
of [1..k], where k is the degree of the ambient module):
s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] iff
P[c<sub>2</sub>] &gt; P[c<sub>1</sub>] or c<sub>1</sub> = c<sub>2</sub> and s<sub>1</sub> &lt;<sub>R</sub> s<sub>2</sub>.
The order is specified by the arguments (<TT>"potperm", P</TT>).
<P>
This order first compares the columns using the given permutation,
and then compares the underlying monomials.


<H4><A NAME = "13789">Block TOP-TOP: <TT>TOPTOP</TT></A></H4>

<P>
<P>
Definition (given a integer k): say that a column c
is in the 1st block if c &le;k and in the 2nd block if c &gt; k;
then s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] iff c<sub>2</sub> is in the 1st block and c<sub>1</sub>
is in the 2nd block, or if the columns are in the same block and
s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] w.r.t. the <TT>TOP</TT> order.
<P>
This order is a block order, like an elimination order for polynomial
rings: comparison is first made on the blocks in which the columns
lie, and then the <TT>TOP</TT> order is applied within each block.
A GB w.r.t. this order is easier in general to compute than the
<TT>POT</TT> order and so is useful when one wishes to `eliminate' the
first k columns only in a GB.


<H4><A NAME = "13790">Block TOP-POT: <TT>TOPPOT</TT></A></H4>

<P>
<P>
Definition (given a integer k): say that a column c
is in the 1st block if c &le;k and in the 2nd block if c &gt; k;
then s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] iff c<sub>2</sub> is in the 1st block and c<sub>1</sub>
is in the 2nd block, or if the columns are in the same block and
s<sub>1</sub>[c<sub>1</sub>] &lt; s<sub>2</sub>[c<sub>2</sub>] w.r.t. the <TT>TOP</TT>/<TT>POT</TT> order
(respective to the 1st/2nd blocks).
<P>
This order is a block order, like an elimination order for polynomial
rings: comparison is first made on the blocks in which the columns
lie, and then the <TT>TOP</TT> order is applied within the 1st block
and the <TT>POT</TT> order is applied within the 2nd block.  This
is similar to the <TT>TOPTOP</TT> order, but it may be preferable
to order the 2nd block w.r.t. the <TT>POT</TT> order.
Note: <TT>POTPOT</TT> would equal to <TT>POT</TT>, and <TT>POTTOP</TT> does
not seem to be useful.
