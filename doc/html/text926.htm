This chapter describes finitely presented algebras (FPAs) in Magma.
An FPA is a quotient of a free associative algebra by an ideal of relations.
To compute with these ideals, one constructs
<I>noncommutative</I> Gr&ouml;bner bases (GBs), which have many
parallels with the standard commutative GBs, discussed in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1203.htm#13438">GR&Ouml;BNER BASES</A>.
At the heart of the theory is a noncommutative version of the
<I>Buchberger algorithm</I> which computes a GB of an ideal of an
algebra starting from an arbitrary basis (generating set) of the ideal.
One significant difference with the commutative case is that a
noncommutative GB may not be finite for a finitely-generated ideal.
For overviews of the theory and the basic algorithms, see

Magma also contains an implementation of a noncommutative generalization
of the Faugere F<sub>4</sub> algorithm (due to Allan Steel), based on sparse linear
algebra techniques, which usually performs dramatically better than the
Buchberger algorithm, and so this is used by Magma by default.
