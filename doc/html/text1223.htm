<P>
Magma allows the extension to and contraction from the ring of quotients
of an ideal, defined over a field, with respect to certain variables.
See <A  HREF = "text1213.htm#bib_BeckerWeispfenning">[BW93, pp. 54--58 and 388--397]</A> for the relevant
definitions and theory.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given an ideal I of the polynomial ring P = K[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>],
where K is a field,
together with a sequence U of integers each between 1 and n, create
the (ring of quotients) extension Q of P, and return the
ideal J of Q, together with the map f: P -&gt; Q.
<P>
If U has length k and the values (in order) of U are
u<sub>1</sub>, ..., u<sub>k</sub>, then first the rational function field
F = K(x<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub>, ..., x<sub>u<sub>k</sub></sub>) is constructed, then the list
v<sub>1</sub>, ..., v<sub>n - k</sub> is constructed as the list
1, ..., n with the u<sub>i</sub> removed, and finally the
extension Q of P is defined to be the polynomial ring
F[x<sub>v<sub>1</sub></sub>, ..., x_(v<sub>n - k</sub>)] =
K(x<sub>u<sub>1</sub></sub>, ..., x<sub>u<sub>k</sub></sub>)[x<sub>v<sub>1</sub></sub>, ..., x_(v<sub>n - k</sub>)].
<P>
The map f is constructed in the obvious way so that x<sub>i</sub>
is mapped to the appropriate variable in F if i is in U,
or the appropriate variable in Q
otherwise.  The image under f of an ideal of P is just
the appropriate ideal of Q whose basis is obtained by taking the
image under f of each of the polynomials in the basis of I.
<P>
The inverse image under f of a polynomial of Q is obtained
by first making the polynomial monic, then multiplying by the LCM
of the denominators ("clearing the denominators"), then mapping
each variable back to the appropriate one in P---this is possible
since there are no proper denominators.  The inverse image under
f of an ideal H of Q
is defined to be the ideal of P generated by the
inverse images under f of the polynomials in the basis of H
(note that this is not always equal to the contraction of H---see
<A  HREF = "text1213.htm#bib_BeckerWeispfenning">[BW93, p. 389]</A>, for a simple algorithm to compute
the contraction of an ideal of Q).
