Splice diagrams arise from resolution graphs by a reduction procedure
and conversely resolution graphs arise from splice diagrams by a continued
fraction calculation.
At present, Magma only incorporates the former calculation.
However, when a splice diagram s has been constructed using a curve
singularity, the corresponding resolution graph g is calculated
and can be recovered using the function <TT>CorrespondingResolutionGraph</TT>.
The vertices of s correspond to a subset of those of g.
The correspondence can be recovered with the function
<TT>CorrespondingVertices</TT>.

By default Magma always makes the reduced splice diagram since otherwise many
determinants would be calculated unnecessarily.

The translation of resolution graph g to splice diagram is done in two steps.
First the underlying graph of g is reduced by the removal of all vertices
of valency 2 (including arrows in the valency calculation).
Then the edge labels are calculated using determinants of subgraphs.

A splice diagram of the resolution graph g.
All parameters can take the value 0 or 1.
If <TT>Reduced</TT> is 1 then the splice diagram will be reduced,
otherwise it will be the splice diagram on the underlying graph of g.
<P>
The parameter <TT>L</TT> refers to the total linking numbers of the vertices
of the resulting splice diagram.
The parameter <TT>K</TT> refers to the canonical class of the vertices
of the resulting splice diagram.
Each quantity will be calculated when the corresponding parameter is 1.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The splice diagram of the resolution graph g with the condition that the vertex v will not be removed
by a reduction.
