<I>Multigraphs</I> and <I>multidigraphs</I> are 
  graphs and digraphs which may have
  multiple (i.e., parallel) edges and loops.
This is in contrast to simple graphs (see Section <A  HREF = "text1783.htm#19677">Introduction</A>
  in the chapter on graphs).
In the context of this chapter we use the term "graph"
  as a generic term for the general vertex-edge incident structure,
  and the term "multigraph"
  as a generic term 
  whenever we want to emphasize the possible existence of 
  multiple edges and loops.
Thus, graphs and multigraphs may be directed
  or undirected.
The meaning of the terms "graph" and "multigraph" should be made clear
  from the context in which they occur.
<P>
Multigraphs are represented in the form of an adjacency list; for more information
  on this topic 
  we refer the reader to Section <A  HREF = "text1785.htm#19713">Graphs with a Sparse Representation</A>.
As is the case for simple graphs, the vertices and edges 
  of a multigraph may be given "decorations".
More precisely, they may be labelled; in addition the edges may also 
  be assigned a capacity (if one is interested in flow problems)
  and/or a weight (for investigation of shortest path problems).
<P>
For convenience, Magma provides users with <I>networks</I>:
  in the Magma context, a network is understood 
  as being a multidigraph whose edges are <I>always</I>
  given a capacity.
Any Magma function that takes a network as an argument
 will usually take any graph whose edges have a capacity
 as an argument.
Networks are covered in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1824.htm#20271">NETWORKS</A>;
  a few functionalities 
  specific to networks will, however, be discussed in the 
  general multigraph context whenever there is a need to highlight 
  some differences between networks and general multi(di)graphs.
<P>
<P>
In particular, almost
  all the standard graph construction functions (see 
  Section <A  HREF = "text1814.htm#20112">Standard Construction for  Multigraphs</A>) preserve the graph's
  support set and  vertex and edge decorations.
That is, the resulting graph will have a support and 
  vertex and edge decorations compatible with the original 
  graph and the operation performed on that graph.
<P>
A Magma multigraph object has type <TT>GrphMultUnd</TT>, a multidigraph 
  has type <TT>GrphMultDir</TT>, and a network has type <TT>GrphNet</TT>.
All three objects are of type <TT>GrphMult</TT>.
<P>
The multigraph facilities represent a significant subset of the (simple) 
graph functionality.  Consequently, some sections of this chapter are 
very similar to their counterparts in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1782.htm#19676">GRAPHS</A>.  For the
sake of clarity, this chapter describes the complete multigraph functionality.
