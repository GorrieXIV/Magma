This section lists various attributes of lattices which can be
examined and set by the user. This allows low-level control of
information stored in lattices. Note that when an attribute is set,
only minimal testing can be done on the value so if an incorrect value
is set, unpredictable results may occur. Note also that if an
attribute is not set, referring to it in an expression (using the `
operator) will <I>not</I> trigger the calculation of it (while
intrinsic functions do); rather an error will ensue. Use the <TT>assigned</TT> operator to test whether an attribute is set.  


<H5><A NAME = "3075">L`Minimum : Lat -&gt; RngElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The attribute for the minimum of a rational or integer lattice L.  If
the attribute <TT>L`Minimum</TT> is examined, either the minimum
is known so it is returned or an error results.
If the attribute <TT>L`Minimum</TT> is set by assignment,
it must be a positive number equal to the minimum of the lattice.
Magma will not check that this is correct since that may be very
time-consuming.  If the attribute is already set, the new value must
be the same as the old value.

<H5><A NAME = "3076">L`MinimumBound : Lat -&gt; RngElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The attribute for an upper bound to the minimum of a rational or
integer lattice L.  If the attribute <TT>L`MinimumBound</TT> is
examined, either an upper bound to the minimum is known so it is
returned or an error results. If the attribute <TT>L`MinimumBound</TT> is
set by assignment, it must be a positive number greater than or equal
to the minimum of the lattice.  Magma will not check that this
is correct since that may be very time-consuming.  If the attribute is
already set, the new value must be the same as or smaller than the old
value.
