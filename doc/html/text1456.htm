<P>
An elliptic curve over K = k(C) may be regarded as a surface E over k
with a map &pi;:E -&gt; C (in other words, an <I>elliptic
surface</I>); the generic fibre of E is E. Under this interpretation,
elements of the Mordell--Weil group E(K) are in one-to-one correspondence
with sections of &pi;.
(A section is a morphism s:C -&gt; E such that &pi;<IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> s = Id<sub>C</sub>.)
This means that one may study the Mordell--Weil group by studying the
geometry of the surface.
<P>
Given E, there is a unique E up to isomorphism that is projective,
regular, and relatively minimal.  This is called the Kodaira--N&eacute;ron
model, and we will always assume that we are working with this model of
the surface.
<P>
Let bar k denote the separable closure of k, and E<sub>bar k</sub>
the elliptic surface considered over bar k.
The N&eacute;ron--Severi group NS(Ekbar) of Ekbar
is the group of divisors of
Ekbar modulo algebraic equivalence. It is a finitely
generated group and is closely connected with the Mordell--Weil group E(K).
<P>
Let N be the subgroup of NS(Ekbar) that is generated
by all components of all the fibres of &pi; together with the section
corresponding to the zero point of E(bar k(C)); this is known as the
<I>trivial lattice</I> of NS(Ekbar). It can
easily be determined since the number of components in reducible fibres can
be computed by Tate's algorithm.
The following divisor classes together form a basis of N
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>the image of the section corresponding to the zero point;
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>one complete fibre; and
<P>
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD>the components of all the reducible fibres, with
        one component from each fibre omitted.
<P>
</DL>
  It is known that the quotient NS(Ekbar)/N is generated by images
  of sections of &pi;, and that NS(Ekbar)/N isomorphic to E(bar k(C))
  (via the identification of sections with points). In
  particular, this implies the Shioda--Tate formula
  rank(E(bar k(C))) + 2 + &sum;<sub>v&isin;C(bar k)</sub> (m<sub>v</sub> - 1) =
  rank(NS(Ekbar)) where m<sub>v</sub> denotes the number of components of the
  fibre &pi;<sup> - 1</sup>(v).
<P>
The Galois group G=G<sub>bar k/k</sub> acts on NS(Ekbar), and it maps
N to itself. Moreover, after extending scalars to Q one can
split the Galois representation. That is, there exists
M&sub;NS(Ekbar) tensor Q such that NS(Ekbar) tensor Q isomorphic to M direct-sum (N tensor Q) and M isomorphic to E(bar k(C)) tensor Q as G-modules. In
particular, M<sup>G</sup> isomorphic to E(K) tensor Q. In the case that k is a
finite field, the Frobenius action on N can be determined with the
functions <TT>FrobeniusActionOnReducibleFiber</TT> and <TT>FrobeniusActionOnTrivialLattice</TT>.
<P>
In order to study NS(Ekbar) as a G-module, one can embed it in the
ell-adic cohomology group H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>). To get a
G-equivariant map one must slightly change the G-action
on H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>). Let H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)(1) denote the (1)-Tate
twist of H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>). The main property that we need to
know about this twist is that it transforms the q-eigensubspace in
H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>) of
some q-Frobenius element to the 1-eigenspace of this Frobenius in
H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)(1). The cycle class map then yields a
G-equivariant embedding
NS(Ekbar) tensor Q<sub>ell</sub> -&gt; H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)(1).
It is conjectured by Tate that the image of
(NS(Ekbar) tensor Q<sub>ell</sub>)<sup>G</sup> under this map exactly equals
H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)(1)<sup>G</sup>.
<P>
In the case that k is a finite field one can in principal determine
H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)(1)<sup>G</sup> via the Lefschetz trace formula. Suppose that
k&sub;F<sub>q</sub> and let F<sub>q</sub>
denote the q-th power Frobenius map. Then
#E(F<sub>q</sub>)=1 + q<sup>2</sup> - (1 + q)Trace(F<sub>q</sub>|H<sup>1</sup>(C<sub>bar k</sub>, Q<sub>ell</sub>)) +
Trace(F<sub>q</sub>|H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)).
<P>
The trace on H<sup>1</sup>(C<sub>bar k</sub>, Q<sub>ell</sub>) is zero if C is a rational
curve, and it can be determined by counting F<sub>q</sub>-rational points on C
in the general case.  Hence one can determine Trace(F<sub>q</sub>|H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>))
by counting F<sub>q</sub>-rational points on E.  By doing this for
various powers of q one can determine the characteristic polynomial
of F<sub>q</sub> acting on H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>), and hence the conjectural ranks of
E(bar k(C)) and E(K) by using Tate's conjectures. The conjectural
ranks obtained in this way give unconditional upper bounds on the true ranks.
<P>
As the Galois action on N can be determined, the difficult part is
to compute
det(1 - T.F<sub>q</sub>|H<sup>2</sup>(Ekbar, Q<sub>ell</sub>)/im(N tensor Q<sub>ell</sub>)), where
im(N tensor Q<sub>ell</sub>) stands for the image of N tensor Q<sub>ell</sub> under
the cycle class map. It can be shown that this polynomial is equal to
the L-function of E over K; it follows that this L-function
is a polynomial. This shows that Tate's conjectures are linked to a
geometric version of the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture. Just as
in the number field case, this conjecture expresses the rank and the
product of the order of the
Tate--Shafarevich group and the regulator of E in terms of its
L-function. The L-function can be computed with the function
<TT>LFunction</TT> and the conjectural information on the rank,
Tate--Shafarevich group, and regulator can be obtained with the function
<TT>AnalyticInformation</TT>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
If E can be defined by a Weierstrass equation in which the
coefficients a<sub>i</sub> are polynomials of degree at most i, then Ekbar is
a rational surface and rank(NS(Ekbar))=10. In this case
rank(E(bar k(C)))=10 - rank(N) can be easily determined. In the case that k is
a finite field then E(bar k(C)) and E(K) can be computed using
functions in this section.
