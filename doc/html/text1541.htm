The models are projective models of the complete curve X<sub>0</sub>(N) over (Q). In the genus 0
case, we simple take the projective line (P)<sup>1</sup> with the point at infinity corresponding
to the cusp at infinity &infin;. In the genus 1 case, we take a <TT>CrvEll</TT> which is
the standard minimal Weierstrass model of the elliptic curve (X<sub>0</sub>(N), &infin;) with the cusp &infin;
as the 0 point for the group law. In the hyperelliptic cases (see <A  HREF = "text1538.htm#bib_Ogg74">[Ogg74]</A>), we take a 
minimal Weierstrass model with two rational points at infinity, the cusp &infin; (which is
never a hyperelliptic Weierstrass point) and its image under the hyperelliptic involution.
<P>
In all other cases (non-subhyperelliptic), we have followed the rule of taking a plane model
(in (P)<sup>2</sup>) or a non-singular model in (P)<sup>3</sup>. In fact, we have only used (P)<sup>3</sup>
models in the genus 4 cases. For genus 3 and 4, we take a canonical model (non-singular plane
quartic and non-singular complete intersection of a quadric and a cubic respectively). For
genus 5 and 6, we find a smallest degree singular birational plane model. These plane curves
are of degree 6 in all cases. The singularities are mainly nodes (type A<sub>2</sub>) and simple cusps (type
A<sub>3</sub>) and often under cuspidal points, though there are some more complex ones of higher A<sub>n</sub> type.
All of the non-singular models that we have produced reduce mod p to non-singular models of
the reduction of X<sub>0</sub>(N) for p not dividing the level N. The singular plane models reduce mod
p (p not dividing N again) to singular plane models of the reduction of X<sub>0</sub>(N) with singularities
of the same type, except for a few cases with small p where nodes become cusps or two singularities
coalesce into a more complex one.
<P>
The initial version of the database contains data for all subhyperelliptic X<sub>0</sub>(N) and all other cases
with genus &le;6 (with a few genus 5 and 6 cases not yet added). This covers all N &lt; 60
along with about half of the N between 60 and 80 and N=81, 121.
<P>
We briefly indicate how the models were arrived at. Equations in the genus 0 and elliptic cases and
modular functions giving the coordinate generators are reasonably well-known (see <A  HREF = "text1538.htm#bib_Li75">[Lig75]</A> for the elliptic
cases), though we found them again anyway as part of our general procedure of searching for small degree
rational functions on X<sub>0</sub>(N). We considered functions generated by Dedekind eta products and weight 2 integral
forms coming from eta products, various types of theta series and Eisenstein series. For the hyperelliptic cases
with genus g, functions x and y with poles at &infin; giving a y<sup>2</sup>=f(x) type Weierstrass equation are
determined from constructing weight two cusp forms G and F with q-expansions q<sup>g - 1</sup> + .. and q<sup>g</sup> + ..
respectively. These were found in terms of eta products and theta forms and the results
were checked against the output of Magma's modular forms package.
<P>
In the non-subhyperelliptic cases, we started from a canonical image simplified by applying LLL as
output by <TT>ModularCurveQuotient</TT>, occasionally slightly adapting this to get good reduction at 2.
In the genus 5 and 6 cases, we determined minimal degree (singular) plane models from these. Genus 5
is fairly straightforward. For the method to find degree 6 plane images in the genus 6 case, see
<A  HREF = "text1538.htm#bib_mike_harr_gen56_11">[Har13]</A> where the genus 5 case is also discussed.
<P>
Having determined a model as the image of the mapping X<sub>0</sub>(N) into (P)<sup>r - 1</sup> by z |-&gt; [f<sub>1</sub>(z): ... :f<sub>r</sub>(z)], r=3 or 4, we then found expressions for the weight 2 forms f<sub>i</sub> of
the type described above (eta products etc.). For more information on this, see the subsection
<A  HREF = "text1547.htm#17393">Modular Generators and  q-Expansions</A> where we also give intrinsics to return a symbolic description of
the construction of the generating modular functions/forms and to return q-expansions up to a
desired precision. We wished to have concrete expressions for these functions/forms in terms of
certain basic types, independent of the generic modular symbol method of generating q-expansions
for bases of forms. It also allows for slightly faster reconstruction of q-expansions.

The first intrinsic returns the model for X<sub>0</sub>(N) over the rationals from the small modular
curve database. The second returns the base change of this to K, which should be a characteristic
zero field.
<P>
If there is no database entry yet for level N, a runtime error results.
