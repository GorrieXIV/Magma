A binary quadratic form is a polynomial ax<sup>2</sup> + bxy + cy<sup>2</sup> with integer
coefficients a, b, c.  The form is primitive if the coefficients 
have no common factor.  Only primitive forms are considered here.
The discriminant of a form is D = b<sup>2</sup> - 4 a c.  For negative 
discriminants, only positive definite forms are considered, i.e. 
a and hence c must be positive.
In Magma forms are printed as tuples &lt; (a, b, c) &gt;.  
<P>
Binary quadratic forms are related to many other topics in number theory, 
including quadratic fields, modular forms and complex multiplication.
Algorithms for binary quadratic forms provide efficient means of 
computing ideal class groups of orders in quadratic fields.  
By using the explicit relation of definite quadratic forms with 
lattices with nontrivial endomorphism ring in the complex plane, 
one can apply modular and elliptic functions to forms, and exploit 
the analytic theory of complex multiplication. 
<P>
Quadratic forms of a given discriminant D correspond to ordered 
bases of ideals in an order in a quadratic number field, 
up to scaling by the rationals.  For negative discriminants,
the primitive reduced forms in this structure are in bijection 
with the class group of invertible ideals.  For positive 
discriminants, the reduced orbits of forms are used for this purpose. 
Efficient algorithms are provided for composition, enumeration of 
reduced forms, class group computations, and discrete logarithms.
The functions are implemented for quadratic forms for all discriminants, 
not only fundamental discriminants.  Maps between forms of different
discriminants are also provided.
<P>
The functionality for binary quadratic forms is rounded out with various 
functions for applying modular and elliptic functions to forms, and for
class polynomials associated to class groups of definite forms.
