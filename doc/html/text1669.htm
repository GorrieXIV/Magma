<P>
<P>
This package deals with cuspidal spaces of weight 2 modular forms 
on &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N), over any imaginary quadratic field. 
In the current version, one can compute Hecke operators for 
principal ideals on these spaces, and determine the newforms.  
The package will be developed further in the future.
<P>
We will refer to modular forms over imaginary quadratic fields as 
<I>Bianchi modular forms</I>.  These are defined similarly to classical modular 
forms, with the modular group SL(2, ZZ) is replaced by SL(2, O<sub>F</sub>), where
O<sub>F</sub> is the ring of integers in an imaginary quadratic field F. 
This group acts on HH<sub>3</sub>, 3-dimensional hyperbolic space,
and Bianchi modular forms (of weight k &ge;2) are functions on HH<sub>3</sub> 
that satisfy a natural automorphy relation under this action.  
<P>
For an ideal N of O<sub>F</sub>, the congruence subgroup &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N) of GL(2, O<sub>F</sub>) 
is defined as the subgroup of matrices that are upper triangular modulo N.
The space of <I>Bianchi modular forms on</I> F <I>of level</I> N is defined 
as the space of functions satisfying the automorphy relation on the subgroup 
&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N).
<P>
For precise definitions see <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_ElstrodtGrunewaldMennicke">[EGM98]</A>. 
<P>
There exist several previous implementations of weight 2 Bianchi modular forms,
each for specific fields F.  These projects are described in 
<A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_CremonaHyperbolic">[Cre84]</A> and references cited there for Euclidean fields, 
<A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_WhitleyThesis">[Whi90]</A> for fields of class number one, <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_BygottThesis">[Byg99]</A> 
for QQ(Sqrt( - 5)) and <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_LinghamThesis">[Lin05]</A> for QQ(Sqrt( - 23)) and QQ(Sqrt( - 31)).

A theorem of Franke states that for algebraic group (G) defined over QQ and 
arithmetic subgroup &Gamma;,  
<P>
<P>
H<sup> * </sup>(&Gamma;;E) simeq H<sup> * </sup>(tenfrak(g), K;A(&Gamma;, G) tensor E)
<P>
where A(&Gamma;, G) denotes the space of automorphic forms.
Thus we can think of the cohomology H<sup> * </sup>(&Gamma;;E) as a concrete realization 
of certain automorphic forms.
<P>
Ash, Gunnells, and Lee-Szczarba <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_LSz">[LS78]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_Aunst">[Ash94]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_Gunnells2000">[Gun00]</A> define a homology complex 
S<sup> * </sup>(&Gamma;) known as the <I>sharbly complex</I>.  A theorem of Borel-Serre 
<A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_BorelSerre">[BS73]</A> gives
<P>
H<sup>&nu; - k</sup>(&Gamma;;CC) simeq H<sub>k</sub>(S_ * (&Gamma;)), 
<P>
where &nu; = vcd(&Gamma;) is the <I>virtual cohomological dimension</I> of &Gamma;.
<P>
There is a natural Hecke action on this complex which agrees with the Hecke 
action on the automorphic forms.  
<P>
The space of positive definite binary Hermitian
 forms over F form an open cone in a real vector space.  There is a natural
 decomposition of this cone into polyhedral cones corresponding to the facets 
of the Vor polyhedron <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_Gunnells1999">[Gun99]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_koecher">[Koe60]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_Ash1977">[Ash77]</A>.  These facets are in 1-1 
correspondence with perfect forms over F.  The polyhedral cones give rise 
to ideal polytopes in HH<sub>3</sub>, 3-dimensional hyperbolic space.  
<P>
The structure of the polytopes allows us to find a finite (modulo &Gamma;) 
spanning set for the sharbly complex.  This is the analogue of unimodular 
symbols in the classical case.  The modular symbol algorithm, for describing 
the action of Hecke operators, can now be replaced by a 0-sharbly reduction 
algorithm.  An advantage of this is, compared with a straightforward generalization
of the usual modular symbols algorithm, is that the number field does not need to be 
Euclidean.  
<P>
Given an imaginary quadratic field F, we compute the structure of the Vor
 polyhedron by computing a complete set of GL<sub>2</sub>(OO)-class representatives 
of perfect forms.  Given a level fn &sube;OO defining the level of the 
congruence subgroup, the polyhedron is used to compute H<sup>2</sup>(&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(fn)).  
Given a prime ideal fp &sub;OO, the 0-sharbly reduction 
algorithm is used to compute the action of the Hecke operator T<sub>fp</sub> on 
H<sup>2</sup>(&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(fn)).  
<P>
The algorithm described in <A  HREF = "text1667.htm#bib_Gunnells1999">[Gun99]</A> is an efficient algorithm for 
computing the Vor polyhedron and provides a replacement for the modular 
symbol algorithm for computing the action of Hecke operators.  
<P>
One advantage of this algorithm is that the most expensive steps come in the 
precomputation phase (computations depending only on the imaginary quadratic 
field).  This means that for a given field, forms of many different 
levels can be computed based on the same precomputation.
<P>
<P>
The cohomology, regarded as a module for the algebra generated by the 
Hecke operators T<sub>fp</sub>, decomposes into an Eisenstein piece and a cuspidal piece.
The cuspidal piece is the same as the cuspidal subspace of modular forms (regarding
both as Hecke modules).
The Eisenstein part is recognisable by looking at Hecke eigenvalues of the
eigenforms contained in it.
By this means, we strip away the Eisenstein part; the space returned is the 
cuspidal subspace only.

Spaces of Bianchi modular forms in Magma are objects of type <TT>ModFrmBianchi</TT>.
<P>
This type shares many features with the type <TT>ModFrmHil</TT> of Hilbert modular forms.
Many of the functions for Hilbert modular forms (see Chapter <A  HREF = "text1656.htm#18551">HILBERT MODULAR FORMS</A>) can also
be applied to Bianchi spaces, such as <TT>NewSubspace</TT>, <TT>NewformDecomposition</TT>, etc.
<P>
Technically, <TT>ModFrmBianchi</TT> is implemented as a subtype of <TT>ModFrmHil</TT>.  
Some intrinsics may not be displayed separately for the two types in Magma,
for instance when one enters <TT>NewSubspace;</TT> at the Magma prompt.


<H4><A NAME = "18610">Verbose Output</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
To see some information printed during computation about what the program is doing,
use <TT>SetVerbose("Bianchi",n)</TT>, where <TT>n</TT> is 0 (silent, by default), 
1 (for concise information), 2, 3 or 4 (which may display bulky data).
