A lattice in Magma is a free Z-module of rank m inside Z<sup>n</sup>,
Q<sup>n</sup>, or R<sup>n</sup>, where m &le;n.  We call m the rank or dimension 
of the lattice and n its degree.  A lattice with m=n is called a 
<I>full</I> lattice.  
There are two pieces of information which completely determine a 
lattice L: the basis matrix B and the inner product matrix M.
M is always a positive definite matrix (i.e., a matrix M such that
vMv<sup>tr</sup> &gt; 0 for all non-zero vectors v&isin;R<sup>n</sup>).
<P>
All other information associated with a lattice L is derived from B and M.
For example, the inner product (., .) for L is given by
(v, w) = v M w<sup>tr</sup> and thus the Gram matrix F for L giving the inner
products of the basis vectors is BMB<sup>tr</sup>.
<P>
Lattices differ from R-spaces in that a lattice is always a Z-module
even if entries of some elements of the lattice are not integers.  For
R-spaces the base ring R affects the module structure but for
lattices the "base ring" R is just defined to be the smallest ring
over which the basis and inner product matrices can be represented.
Magma basically has two kinds of lattices: <I>exact</I>
lattices for which all of the entries of B and M (and thus F) lie in
either Z or Q, and <I>non-exact</I> lattices for which all of the
entries of B and M (and thus F) lie in a particular approximate
real field R.
<P>
For exact lattices, the "base ring" R may be Z or Q as mentioned
above so that elements are represented over R, but otherwise there is
nothing in the lattice which distinguishes between the Z and Q cases.
When exact lattices are printed,
the basis matrix B is presented uniquely as an integral matrix
divided by a minimal positive integral denominator.
The inner product matrix M is presented similarly.
This tends to be a more natural presentation which reflects the Z-module
structure.  Another useful feature of this presentation is that the inner
product can be efficiently defined to be the identity matrix divided by
an appropriate integral scale factor.  In this way, the basis can be kept
rational while still obtaining an integral primitive Gram matrix
(a matrix with integral entries which are coprime), thus avoiding
the need for rescaling the basis by an irrational square root.
This method is followed in the construction of special lattices provided
within Magma.
<P>
For non-exact lattices, the basis matrix B is simply presented as
it is represented over the ring R which is an approximate real field.
Some operations applicable
for exact lattices are not possible for non-exact lattices.
Thus if in the description of a function below it is said that the function
can only be applied to an exact lattice it means that the function
cannot be applied to a lattice over an approximate real field.
<P>
Two lattices are said to be <I>compatible</I> if their inner product matrices
are equal.  Many operations on lattices assume that their arguments are
compatible.  Intuitively, two lattices and their elements are not comparable
if their inner product matrices are different.
<P>
Associated with a lattice L is its coordinate lattice L' which has the
standard basis (i.e., its basis matrix is the identity matrix) but has
the same Gram matrix as L.  Some operations, e.g.,
automorphism group, always work with the coordinates of elements of the lattice,
so it is necessary to move to the coordinate lattice.
<P>
The category of lattices is <A NAME = "Lat"><TT>Lat</TT></A>.
