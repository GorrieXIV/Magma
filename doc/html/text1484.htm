This chapter contains descriptions of functions designed to perform
calculations with hyperelliptic curves and their Jacobians. 
A hyperelliptic curve, which is taken to include the genus one case,
is given by a nonsingular generalized Weierstrass equation
<P>
y<sup>2</sup> + h(x) y = f(x),
<P>
where h(x) and f(x) are polynomials over a field K. The curve 
is viewed as embedded in a weighted projective space, with weights 
1, g + 1, and 1, in which the points at infinity are nonsingular. 
<P>
Functionality for hyperelliptic curves includes optimized algorithms 
for working on genus two curves over Q, including heights on the 
Jacobian, and a datatype for the Kummer surface of the Jacobian. 
For Jacobians of curves over finite fields, there exist specialized 
algorithms for computing the group structure of the set of rational 
points.
<P>
The category of hyperelliptic curves is <A NAME = "CrvHyp"><TT>CrvHyp</TT></A> 
and points on curves are of type <A NAME = "PtHyp"><TT>PtHyp</TT></A>.  
Jacobians of hyperelliptic curves 
are of type <A NAME = "JacHyp"><TT>JacHyp</TT></A> and 
points <A NAME = "JacHypPt"><TT>JacHypPt</TT></A>.  Similarly, the 
Kummer surface of a genus two curve is of type 
<A NAME = "SrfKum"><TT>SrfKum</TT></A> 
with points of type <A NAME = "SrfKumPt"><TT>SrfKumPt</TT></A>.  
<P>
The initial development of machinery for hyperelliptic curves was 
undertaken by Michael Stoll, supported by members of the Magma group.
