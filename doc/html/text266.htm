A separate type is provided for sparse matrices to allow the user
to construct such matrices and apply algorithms which take advantage
of sparsity.  Sparse matrices are distinct from normal 
matrices in Magma, which have a dense representation.
This chapter describes the operations available for creating and
working with sparse matrices. 
<P>
The operations provided for sparse matrices include dynamic construction,
simple properties, and the calculation of a number of non-trivial and
important invariants (such as rank, determinant, or computing a non-zero
vector in the nullspace).  In particular, this datatype supports the
class of <I>index-calculus</I> algorithms which involve generating a
very large sparse system and then solving the system or finding the
elementary divisors of the corresponding matrix (for example, to compute
the abelian group structure).  An extended example presented at the end
of the chapter (<A  HREF = "text278.htm#2572">H27E3</A>) illustrates how an index-calculus
method may be implemented in practice in the Magma language using
the sparse matrix facilities.
<P>
The type name for the category of sparse matrices is <TT>MtrxSprs</TT>.  
All sparse matrices over a given ring R lie in the same 
<I>sparse matrix structure</I>, whose type name is <TT>MtrxSprsStr</TT>.  
The user will, in practice, rarely need to refer explicitly to the 
parent structure.
