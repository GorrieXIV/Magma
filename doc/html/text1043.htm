<P>
<P>
Magma contains character tables of many of the groups available as
an <A  HREF = "text758.htm#ATLASGroup">ATLASGroup</A>. These tables have been computed using the
<A  HREF = "text1040.htm#CharacterTable:Grp">CharacterTable</A> function, and are examples of character tables
without a group.
Characters are returned with parent character ring having a power map assigned.
and with Frobenius-Schur indicator of each character pre-computed.
<P>
The available character tables are named using the name of the corresponding
<A  HREF = "text758.htm#ATLASGroup">ATLASGroup</A>.
<P>
This facility is currently under expansion, and more tables and facilities
will be available with future releases.

We use the texttt{CharacterTable} function to examine some aspects of
the simple group E<sub>6</sub>(2). We start by showing that this is a (2, 3, 7) group.

We have that elements of class 3 (having element order 2) multiplied
by a suitable element of class 6 (element order 3), give a result in class 29
(element order 7). 
<P>
In the proof of Ore's conjecture by Liebeck, O'Brien, Shalev &amp; Tiep,
E<sub>6</sub>(2) was a case where the conjecture was checked directly using
Frobenius' character table criterion for an element to be a commutator.
We can easily repeat this calculation.
The function texttt{test} computes a value for a given conjugacy
class such that this value is non-zero if and only if the class consists of
commutators.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; test := func&lt; k | &amp;+[ x[k]/x[1] : x in X ] &gt;;
&gt; forall{ k : k in [1..#cd] | not IsZero(test(k)) };
true
</PRE>
This shows that all conjugacy classes of E<sub>6</sub>(2) consist of commutators,
verifying the conjecture for this group.
<P>
We now move on to finding characters of rational representations of 
E<sub>6</sub>(2).
It can be shown, using no more than the character table data, that
the second and third characters in this table are afforded by rational
representations of the group.
Given this, we can find other characters of rational representations
in the character table. We verify enough facts to show that
the 2nd and 3rd characters are from rational representations,
and then find others.

We first established that the two characters are both rational valued
with indicators 1.
They both take the value 1 on integral classes such that the orders of
the elements in these classes are coprime.
This is enough to conclude that the Schur index over the rational field
of both these characters is 1, see <A  HREF = "text1038.htm#bib_Feit-Schur-indices">[Fei83]</A>.
It follows that these are characters of rational representations of E<sub>6</sub>(2).
We now consider products of these characters.

This shows that the characters numbered 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 17, 20, 21, 30, 33, 36, 40 
all have Schur index 1 over the rational numbers.
In fact, all these characters are rational valued, so they are characters of
rational representations. Further products give more information.

The characters found above all have Schur index 1. We see that this

We consider the characters of Lyons' sporadic simple group, and compute
Schur indices using character table information.
We will use the methods described in <A  HREF = "text1038.htm#bib_Feit-Schur-indices">[Fei83]</A>, and check the
assertion of <I>op. cit.</I> that all characters of Lyons' group have
Schur index 1. Theorems referenced here refer to this article.
<P>
In general we cannot deduce all local Schur indices from character table
information, but here we are fortunate and can do so.
<P>
We begin by finding the integral classes of the group, and setting up a
texttt{test} function that, when it returns true, implies that the character
has Schur index 1 over the rationals.
We are using Theorem A, Theorem 2.7, and Theorem 2.15.

We have found 28 characters with Schur index 1. Of these, 20 are rational
valued, hence are characters of rational representation of Ly.
We now consider inner products with products of our 20 rational characters
in pairs, to find more characters having Schur index 1.
Here we are using Theorem 2.1 and Corollary 2.4.

We have shown that all but one character (&chi; = &chi;<sub>37</sub>) have
Schur index one.
The character &chi; has degree 36 887 520, indicator 1
(hence Schur index 1 over the real numbers), and is rational valued.
Furthermore, for primes p not&isin;{2, 3, 5, 7, 11} this character has
p-adic Schur index m<sub>p</sub>(&chi;) = 1 (Theorem 2.10).
<P>
We now compute the Schur indices
of &chi; over the remaining p-adic fields. We start with values of
&chi; on group elements of order 11 (class 17).
This may give us information on
the cases p&isin;{2, 3, 5, 7}. We test if characters in the same
p-block as &chi; take values on class 17 that lie in the
p-adic field Q<sub>p</sub>. We use a test for this based on the Galois group
of Q<sub>p</sub>(&zeta;<sub>11</sub>) over Q<sub>p</sub>. This group is cyclic, generated by the
pth conjugacy operation: &zeta;<sub>11</sub> |-&gt; &zeta;<sub>11</sub><sup>p</sup>.

</PRE>
We find that m<sub>3</sub>(&chi;) and m<sub>5</sub>(&chi;)
are divisors of the character value -1, hence are both 1 (Corollary 3.2).
When p=2, 7 we see that characters in the p-block of &chi; take values
outside Q<sub>p</sub>. Noting that the Sylow 7-subgroups of Ly are cyclic,
we get m<sub>7</sub>(&chi;) &gt; 1 (Theorem 2.12).
As real valued characters have all Schur indices 1 or 2,
we have m<sub>7</sub>(&chi;) = 2.
<P>
It remains to decide m<sub>2</sub>(&chi;) and m<sub>11</sub>(&chi;). We must have 
one of these equal to 1 and the other equal to 2 (Theorem 2.15).
We consider group elements of order 21 (class 27) in the same manner as
above.

2 false
11 true
</PRE>
From this information we conclude that m<sub>11</sub>(&chi;) = 1 (Corollary 3.2),
and so m<sub>2</sub>(&chi;) = 2. 
<P>
We see that the statement in S7 of <A  HREF = "text1038.htm#bib_Feit-Schur-indices">[Fei83]</A>, that all
characters of Lyons' group have Schur index 1, is not quite correct.
The character of degree 36 887 520 has 2-adic and 7-adic local
Schur indices equal to 2. All other characters of Ly have Schur index 1.
