A permutation group G is a group of bijections X to X, for some set
X. The group G is said to <I>act</I> on X and the elements of G are
called permutations (of the set X). A given permutation group G may
have actions on sets other than the one on which it is defined. Thus, any
set upon which G has a legitimate action will be called a G-set.
The set X is called the <I>natural G-set</I> for the group G,
and the action of G on X is called the <I>natural action</I> of G. 
Note that the group G also has a natural induced action on the 
G-closure of any <I>derived set</I> of X .
magma expects the G-set X to be of finite cardinality n. 
Usually, X will be {1, 2, ..., n}, but, as we shall see below,
X may be a set of strings, or any other legitimate Magma set. 
<P>
The elements of a G-set are called <I>points</I>. Let Y be a G-set
for G. The (possibly empty) subset of Y whose points are fixed by 
every permutation of G, is called the <I>fixed-point set</I> for G, 
while the subset of Y consisting of points moved by some permutation 
of G is called the <I>support</I> of G.  Similarly, for an element 
g of G the <I>fixed-point set</I> and the <I>support</I> of g are, 
respectively, the subsets of Y consisting of the points fixed and 
moved by g. The <I>degree</I> of G is defined to be the cardinality 
of the natural G-set of G; whereas the <I>degree</I> of an element 
g of G is defined to be the cardinality of the support of g, 
i.e. the number of points moved by g.
<P>
Permutation groups in Magma are limited to degree less than 2<sup>30</sup>.


<H4><A NAME = "6874">The Category of Permutation Groups</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
The family of all permutation groups of finite degree forms a category. The
objects are the permutation groups and the morphisms are group homomorphisms.
The Magma designation for this category of permutation groups is
<A NAME = "GrpPerm"><TT>GrpPerm</TT></A>.


<H4><A NAME = "6875">The Construction of a Permutation Group</A></H4>

<P>
Every permutation group acting on a set X is created as a subgroup of the
symmetric group Sym(X). Thus, the construction of a general permutation
group is a two-step process:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>The appropriate symmetric group, Sym(X), is constructed;
<P>
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>The required group G is then defined as a subgroup of Sym(X).
<P>
<P>
</DL>
For convenience, a constructor <TT>PermutationGroup&lt; ... &gt;</TT>, which combines
these two steps, is provided.
