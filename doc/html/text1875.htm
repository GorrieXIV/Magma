In Chapter <A  HREF = "text1862.htm#20723">LINEAR CODES OVER FINITE RINGS</A> basic functions for working with codes over a
finite ring are described.  Because of the large amount of machinery
developed specifically for Z<sub>4</sub>-codes, this chapter will be devoted
to this special case. The functionality available for Z<sub>4</sub>-codes consists 
of the machinery described in chapter <A  HREF = "text1862.htm#20723">LINEAR CODES OVER FINITE RINGS</A> together with the 
contents of this chapter.
<P>
This chapter includes constructions for some families of codes over Z<sub>4</sub>
(see sections <A  HREF = "text1876.htm#20845">Families of Codes over Z<sub>4</sub></A> and <A  HREF = "text1876.htm#20871">New Codes from Old</A>),  
efficient functions for computing the rank and dimension of the kernel of
any code over Z<sub>4</sub> (Section <A  HREF = "text1877.htm#20887">Structures Associated with the  Gray Map</A>), as well as general 
functions for computing coset representatives for a subcode in a code over 
Z<sub>4</sub> (Section <A  HREF = "text1877.htm#20895">Coset Representatives</A>).  In addition, there are functions for
computing the permutation automorphism group for Hadamard and extended 
perfect codes over Z<sub>4</sub>, and their cardinal (Section <A  HREF = "text1881.htm#20964">Automorphism Groups</A>).
Finally, various algorithms for decoding codes over Z<sub>4</sub> are also provided 
(Section <A  HREF = "text1880.htm#20943">Decoding</A>).  
<P>
Error correcting codes over Z<sub>4</sub> are often referred to as 
<I>quaternary</I> codes.  Important concepts when discussing quaternary 
codes are <I>Lee weight</I> and the <I>Gray map</I>, which maps linear 
codes over Z<sub>4</sub> to (possibly non-linear) codes over Z<sub>2</sub>.
Many good non-linear binary codes can be defined as the images of
simple linear quaternary codes.
A code over Z<sub>4</sub> is a subgroup of Z<sub>4</sub><sup>n</sup>, so it is
isomorphic to an abelian structure Z<sub>2</sub><sup>&gamma;</sup> x Z<sub>4</sub><sup>&delta;</sup> and we will
say that it is of type 2<sup>&gamma;</sup>4<sup>&delta;</sup>, or simply that it has 2<sup>&gamma; + 2&delta;</sup>
codewords. As general references on the available functions in Magma for
codes over Z<sub>4</sub>, the reader is referred to <A  HREF = "text1873.htm#bib_Sole">[HKC+94]</A>, <A  HREF = "text1873.htm#bib_Wan_Z4">[Wan97]</A>.
<P>
For general references on the material in this chapter, the reader is referred 
to the bibliography included at the end of this chapter.
<P>
The machinery described in this chapter largely corresponds to Version 
2.0 of the package <I>Codes over Z<sub>4</sub>: A Magma Package</I> which has 
been developed by Roland D. Barrolleta, Jaume Pernas, Jaume Pujol and 
Merc&egrave; Villanueva  of the Combinatoric, Coding and Security Group (CCSG) 
at the Universitat Aut&ograve;noma de Barcelona.
