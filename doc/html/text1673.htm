The functions described here are very similar to those for Hilbert modular forms
(see Chapter <A  HREF = "text1656.htm#18551">HILBERT MODULAR FORMS</A>).  Some further related intrinsics described there,
such as <TT>HeckeEigenvalue</TT>, can also be applied to Bianchi modular forms.

In these computations it is typically very important to switch on the caching 
feature (see Section <A  HREF = "text1659.htm#18562">Caching Spaces of Modular  Forms</A>).  This is because spaces of lower levels
tend to be used repeatedly.


<H5><A NAME = "18623">NewSubspace(M) : ModFrmBianchi -&gt; ModFrmBianchi</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This computes the new subspace of a given space of Bianchi modular forms.
The algorithm identifies the old spaces in M by comparing the Hecke
action on M and spaces of lower levels.
The algorithm assumes that the dimensions of old spaces are as expected.
This has been extensively tested.

<H5><A NAME = "18624">NewformDecomposition(M) : ModFrmBianchi -&gt; List</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This returns a list of the Hecke-irreducible newform spaces in M,
which is required to be a new space.
The algorithm is the same as for Hilbert modular forms.

<H5><A NAME = "18625">Eigenform(M) : ModFrmBianchi -&gt; ModFrmBianchiElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
This constructs the newform associated to a Hecke-irreducible space M
obtained from <TT>NewformDecomposition</TT>.
