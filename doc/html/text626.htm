Magma contains the following databases of groups:
<P>
<P>
<I>Small Groups</I>: Contains all groups of order up to 1000, excluding orders
512 and 768.
<P>
<P>
<I>Perfect Groups</I>: This database
contains all perfect groups up to order 50000, and many classes of
perfect groups up to order one million.  Each group is defined by
means of a finite presentation.  Further information is also provided
which allows the construction of permutation representations.
<P>
<P>
<I>Rational Maximal Matrix Groups</I>:
Contains rational maximal finite matrix groups
and their invariant forms, for small dimensions (up to 31 at V2.9 and
above). 
Each entry can be accessed either as a matrix group or as a lattice.
<P>
<P>
<I>Quaternionic Matrix Groups</I>:
A database of the finite absolutely irreducible
subgroups of GL<sub>n</sub>((D)) where (D) is a definite
quaternion algebra whose centre has degree d over Q and nd leq10.
Each entry can be accessed either as a matrix group or as a lattice.
<P>
<P>
<I>Transitive Permutation Groups</I>:
Magma has a database containing all transitive permutation groups having 
degree up to 22.
<P>
<P>
<I>Primitive Permutation Groups</I>:
Magma has a database containing all primitive permutation groups having 
degree up to 50.
