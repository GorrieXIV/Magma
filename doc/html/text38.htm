(Interactive load.)
Input the file with the name specified by the string. The file will be
read in, and the text will be treated as Magma input. Tilde
expansion of file names is allowed. In contrast to <TT>load</TT>, the
user has the chance to interact as each line is read in:
<P>
As the line is read in, it is displayed and the system waits for user 
response.
At this point, the user can skip the line (by moving "down"),
edit the line (using the normal editing keys) or execute it (by pressing
"enter").
If the line is edited, the new line is executed and the original line
is presented again.
