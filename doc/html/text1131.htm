This chapter is concerned with finite dimensional Lie algebras. 
A large number of specialised functions are provided for these algebras.
We refer to <A  HREF = "text1129.htm#bib_wdg-lie-alg">[dG00]</A> for a general introduction to the theory 
of Lie algebras and their algorithms. For some of the functions described 
here that rely on a non-trivial algorithm we will indicate a precise 
reference.
<P>
Lie algebras are viewed as free modules over a base ring R with a
multiplication satisfying the usual Lie axioms.  Some functions require 
additional conditions on the base ring; for example, many functions 
require that the base ring be a field.
<P>
The main computational machinery in Magma for Lie algebras assumes that they 
are given either as structure constant algebras or as matrix algebras. Functions
are provided which, given a finitely presented finite dimensional Lie algebra,
will attempt to construct an isomorphic structure constant Lie algebra.
As a structure constant algebra, the Lie algebra L of dimension n over a 
ring R is defined in Magma by giving the n<sup>3</sup> <I>structure constants</I>
a<sub>ij</sub><sup>k</sup> &isin;R (1 &le;i, j, k &le;n) such that, if {e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, ..., e<sub>n</sub>}
is the basis of L,  e<sub>i</sub> * e<sub>j</sub> = &sum;<sub>k = 1</sub><sup>n</sup> a<sub>ij</sub><sup>k</sup> * e<sub>k</sub>.
<P>
In Magma V version there is more functionality for Lie algebras defined
by structure constants than for matrix Lie algebras. Throughout this chapter 
the algebra representation appropriate for a given intrinsic will be noted.
For information on matrix algebras considered as associative algebras see 
Chapter <A  HREF = "text942.htm#10616">MATRIX ALGEBRAS</A>.
<P>
In addition, some functions are provided for finitely presented Lie algebras and
Lie algebras generated by extremal elements, and databases of solvable Lie algebras,
nilpotent Lie algebras, and nilpotent orbits in simple Lie algebras are available.

As mentioned above, the most extensively supported Lie algebras in Magma are 
structure constant Lie algebras and matrix Lie algebras. The methods for constructing
these (by explicitly specifying structure constants or matrices) are described in 
Sections <A  HREF = "text1132.htm#12662">Constructors for Lie Algebras</A>. 
<P>
Well known simple finite Lie algebras can be more easily constructed by specifying 
the type. The classical, reductive, Lie algebras (A<sub>n</sub>, B<sub>n</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>, D<sub>n</sub>, E<sub>6</sub>, 
E<sub>7</sub>, E<sub>8</sub>, F<sub>4</sub>, G<sub>2</sub>) and their twisted variants are described in 
Section <A  HREF = "text1135.htm#12727">Almost Reductive Lie Algebras</A>, the Witt Lie algebras and its derivatives 
(of <I>Cartan-Type</I>) in Section <A  HREF = "text1135.htm#12735">Cartan-Type Lie Algebras</A>, and the Melikian
Lie algebras in Section <A  HREF = "text1135.htm#12744">Melikian Lie Algebras</A>. 
Those interested primarily in classical Lie algebras may want to skip to 
Section <A  HREF = "text1135.htm#12727">Almost Reductive Lie Algebras</A>, which includes a number of examples to get 
started.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
Elementary properties of these Lie algebras (bases, types, Weyl group, etc.) are
described in Section <A  HREF = "text1138.htm#12767">Operations on Lie Algebras</A>. This section also contains information
about isomorphism testing. Other properties (nilpotency, simplicity) 
are discussed in Section <A  HREF = "text1140.htm#12847">Properties of Lie Algebras and Ideals</A>.
Some further operations that only apply to matrix Lie algebras
may be found in Section <A  HREF = "text1143.htm#12880">Operations for Matrix Lie Algebras</A>. 
<P>
Constructors such as direct sums, subalgebras, centralisers, Cartan subalgebras, derived 
series, etc. are treated in Sections <A  HREF = "text1137.htm#12759">Construction of Subalgebras,  Ideals and Quotients</A> and <A  HREF = "text1139.htm#12814">Operations on Subalgebras and Ideals</A>; 
construction of homomorphisms can be found in Section <A  HREF = "text1144.htm#12885">Homomorphisms</A>. The construction 
of elements of Lie algebras is described in Section <A  HREF = "text1136.htm#12747">Construction of Elements</A>, and 
operations on them in Section <A  HREF = "text1141.htm#12860">Operations on Elements</A>. 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
In addition to these Lie algebras Magma supports two other types of Lie algebras.
Firstly finitely presented Lie algebras, as free Lie algebras modulo a set of relations,
described in Section <A  HREF = "text1133.htm#12675">Finitely Presented Lie Algebras</A>.
Secondly Lie algebras generated by extremal elements, described in Section <A  HREF = "text1134.htm#12698">Lie Algebras Generated by Extremal Elements</A>.
<P>
More specialistic functions for structure constant Lie algebras are described in 
Sections <A  HREF = "text1142.htm#12870">The Natural Module</A> (the natural module),
<A  HREF = "text1145.htm#12887">Automorphisms of Classical- type Reductive Algebras</A> (automorphisms of classical-type Lie algebras),
<A  HREF = "text1146.htm#12894">Restrictable Lie Algebras</A> (restrictable Lie algebras), and
<A  HREF = "text1147.htm#12904">Universal Enveloping Algebras</A> (universal enveloping algebras).
<P>
Magma also provides databases and recognition procedures for small-dimensional 
solvable and nilpotent Lie algebras (described in Section <A  HREF = "text1148.htm#12930">Solvable and Nilpotent Lie Algebras Classification</A>), a 
database of semisimple subalgebras of simple Lie algebras (described in 
Section <A  HREF = "text1149.htm#12946">Semisimple Subalgebras of  Simple Lie Algebras</A>), and a database of nilpotent orbits 
in simple Lie algebras (described in Section <A  HREF = "text1150.htm#12951">Nilpotent Orbits in Simple Lie Algebras</A>).

Other chapters that may be of interest are Chapter <A  HREF = "text1153.htm#12968">KAC-MOODY LIE ALGEBRAS</A> on
Kac-Moody Lie algebras and Chapter <A  HREF = "text1159.htm#13002">QUANTUM GROUPS</A> on Quantum Groups.
Furthermore, Chapter <A  HREF = "text1192.htm#13290">REPRESENTATIONS OF LIE GROUPS  AND ALGEBRAS</A> deals with representations of Lie algebras 
and groups of Lie type. Of particular importance is Section <A  HREF = "text1195.htm#13302">Lie Algebras</A>, 
dealing with the construction of representations of Lie algebras.
