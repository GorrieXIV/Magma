A <I>set</I> in Magma is a (usually unordered) collection of objects
belonging to some common structure (called the <I>universe</I>
of the set).
There are four basic types of sets: <I>enumerated sets</I>, whose
elements are all stored explicitly (with one exception, see
below); <I>formal sets</I>,
whose elements are stored implicitly by means of a predicate that allows
for testing membership; <I>indexed sets</I>, which are restricted
enumerated sets having a numbering on elements; and <I>multisets</I>,
which are enumerated sets with possible repetition of elements.
In particular, enumerated and indexed sets and multisets are always finite, and
formal sets are allowed to be infinite.

Enumerated sets are finite, and can be specified in three basic ways (see
also section 2 below): by listing all elements; by an expression involving
elements of some finite structure; and by an arithmetic progression. If
an arithmetic progression is specified, the elements are not calculated
explicitly until a modification of the set necessitates it; in all other
cases all elements of the enumerated set are stored explicitly.


<H4><A NAME = "600">Formal Sets</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
A formal set consists of the subset of elements of some
carrier set (structure) on which a certain predicate assumes the value `true'.
<P>
The only set-theoretic operations that can be performed on formal sets are
union, intersection, difference and symmetric difference, and element
membership testing.


<H4><A NAME = "601">Indexed Sets</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
For some purposes it is useful to be able to access elements of a set
through an index map, which numbers the elements of the set. For that
purpose Magma has indexed sets, on which a very few basic set operations
are allowed (element membership testing) as well as some sequence-like
operations (such as accessing the i-th term, getting the index of
an element, appending and pruning).


<H4><A NAME = "602">Multisets</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
For some purposes it is useful to construct a set with some of its members
repeated.  For that
purpose Magma has multisets, 
which take into account the repetition of members.
The number of times an object x occurs in a multiset S is
called the <I>multiplicity</I> of x in S.  Magma has the ^^ 
operator to specify a multiplicity: the expression <TT>x^^ n</TT> means
the object x with multiplicity n.  In the following, whenever any
multiset constructor or function expects an element y, the expression
x^^ n may usually be used.


<H4><A NAME = "603">Compatibility</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
The binary operators for sets do not allow mixing of the four types of
sets (so one cannot take the intersection of an enumerated set
and a formal set, for example), but it is easy to convert an enumerated set
into a formal set -- see the section on binary operators below -- and there
are functions provided for making an enumerated set out of an indexed set
or a multiset (and vice versa).
<P>
By the limitation on their construction formal sets can only contain elements
from one structure in Magma. The elements of enumerated sets are also
restricted, in the sense that either some universe must be
specified upon creation, or Magma must be able to find such universe
automatically. The rules for compatibility of elements and the way Magma
deals with these universes are the same for sequences and sets, and are described
in the previous chapter.
The restrictions on indexed sets are the same as those for enumerated sets.

Certain expressions appearing in the sections below
(possibly with subscripts) have a standard interpretation:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>U</DT><DD>the universe: any Magma structure;
<DT>E</DT><DD>the carrier set for enumerated sets:
any enumerated structure (it must be possible to loop over
its elements -- see the Introduction to this Part (Chapter <A  HREF = "text80.htm#588">INTRODUCTION TO AGGREGATES</A>));
<DT>F</DT><DD>the carrier set for formal sets:
any structure for which membership testing using <TT>in</TT>
is defined -- see the Introduction to this Part (Chapter <A  HREF = "text80.htm#588">INTRODUCTION TO AGGREGATES</A>));
<DT>x</DT><DD>a free variable which successively takes the
elements of E (or F in the formal case) as its values;
<DT>P</DT><DD>a Boolean expression that usually involves the
variable(s) x, x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>k</sub>;
<DT>e</DT><DD>an expression that also usually involves the
variable(s) x, x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>k</sub>.</DL>
