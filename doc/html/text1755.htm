One area of interest in the theory of symmetric functions is the
study of the change of bases between the five different bases.
The matrices of change of base between the s<sub>&lambda;</sub>, h<sub>&lambda;</sub>, m<sub>&lambda;</sub> and the
e<sub>&lambda;</sub> are all integer matrices. Only when changing 
from one of these four bases to the p<sub>&lambda;</sub>, is the matrix 
over the rationals. For a discussion of their computation and interactions see
<A  HREF = "text1749.htm#bib_MacD">[Mac95, pages 54--58]</A>.
<P>
<P>
In Magma there are routines available to obtain all these matrices. These 
routines are described below. Some interactions of these matrices are verified
in examples.

Computes the matrix for the expansion of a Schur function 
indexed by a partition of weight n as a 
sum of monomial symmetric functions. This matrix is also 
known as the table of <I>Kostka</I> numbers. These are the numbers
of tableaux of each shape and content.
The content of a tableau prescribes its entries, so for example a tableau 
with content [2, 1, 4, 1] has two 1's, one 2, four 3's and one 4.
The entries of the
matrix are non negative integers. The matrix is upper triangular.

Compute the base change matrix from the Schur functions to the monomial
symmetric functions for degree 5. 
The entries in this matrix are what are known as the <I>Kostka</I> numbers.
They count the number of young tableaux on a given shape
Look on the order of 
the labelling partitions, and check whether the entry 3 in
the upper right corner is right by
generating the corresponding tableaux.

In the character table the first row is the unity character, which corresponds
to the first column of the transition matrix. The second row of the character table
is the alternating character which corresponds to the last column of the 
transition matrix. The first column of the character table contains the dimensions of the
irreducible characters, this is the last row of the transition matrix.
