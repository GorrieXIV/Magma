A matrix group G may be defined over any ring R for which Magma 
has a method for computing the inverse of a matrix. However, the
availability of machinery for determining structural information is 
dependent upon the properties of the base ring R. 
<P>
<P>
We distinguish several different cases.
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>If the ring R is a finite field then the group must be
finite.  If the group has moderate degree and it is possible to find a
low dimensional subspace of the natural vector space for G whose
orbit under G has length bounded by a million or so, then it is
possible to construct a stabilizer chain representation for the group
similar to that used for permutation groups (the <I>BSGS
representation</I> <A  HREF = "text652.htm#bib_butler-schreier-matrix">[But76]</A>). In order to increase
the chances of finding a short orbit the Murray-O'Brien
<A  HREF = "text652.htm#bib_murray-obrien">[MO95]</A> strategy for selecting base points is used.  The
availability of a BSGS representation allows the structure of the
group to be investigated in detail.
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>If the coefficient ring R is a finite field but the
degree and size of the group are such that it is not possible to
construct a useful BSGS representation then the group may be
investigated using techniques based on a theorem of Aschbacher that
classifies the maximal subgroups of GL(n, q). This approach is under
intensive development by Leedham-Green, O'Brien and others.  Code
implementing some parts is documented in Chapter <A  HREF = "text734.htm#8331">ALMOST SIMPLE GROUPS</A>.
<P>
<DT>(iii)</DT><DD>If the ring R is the Euclidean Ring Z/mZ, then 
the group must be finite.  If the group has moderate degree and it is
possible to find a vector in the natural R-module for G whose orbit
has length bounded by a million or so, then again it is possible to
compute structural information using the BSGS representation.
<P>
<DT>(iv)</DT><DD>If the ring R has infinite cardinality and satisfies
certain properties, Magma can sometimes determine whether the group is 
finite or infinite. In particular, this can be done when R is the ring 
of integers, the field of rational numbers, or an algebraic number field
(including cyclotomic and quadratic fields). If G is infinite, and has
not been created as a Lie group, then Magma currently provides little
beyond basic arithmetic on elements.
<P>
<DT>(v)</DT><DD>If the ring R has infinite cardinality but the group G
is finite and R is either a field or an Euclidean Domain then it may be
possible to construct a <I>BSGS representation</I> as above and thereby
undertake structural computation.
<P>
<DT>(vi)</DT><DD>If an (infinite) matrix group can be created as a Lie group
then machinery based on Lie Theory may be used to analyse the group.
The facilities for Lie groups are described in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1175.htm#13090">GROUPS OF LIE TYPE</A>.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
Matrix groups over rings of infinite cardinality may be created regardless
as to whether they are finite or not. If the coefficient ring R is 
either the ring of integers, the rational field, a quadratic field, 
a cyclotomic field, or a number field a matrix group may then be tested 
for finiteness by use of the function <TT>IsFinite</TT>.  However, most 
functions that determine structural properties of a group apply only 
to finite groups.

<P>
<P>
Matrix groups may be defined over any ring for which Magma has a method for
computing matrix inverses. However, the structure algorithms assume that the 
group is finite and is defined over either a field, an Euclidean Domain or the 
Euclidean Ring Z/mZ.


<H4><A NAME = "7396">The Category of Matrix Groups</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
The family of matrix groups over a particular ring R forms a category where 
the objects are the matrix groups and the morphisms are group homomorphisms.
The collection of all matrix groups forms a family of categories indexed by 
the category of rings.  The Magma designation for this family of 
categories of matrix groups is <A NAME = "GrpMat"><TT>GrpMat</TT></A>.


<H4><A NAME = "7397">The Construction of a Matrix Group</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
A group of n x n matrices defined over the ring R is created as a 
subgroup of the general linear group GL(n, R). Thus the construction of 
a general matrix group is a two step process:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>The appropriate general linear group, GL(n, R), is constructed;
<P>
<P>
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>The required group G is then defined as a subgroup of GL(n, R).
<P>
<P>
</DL>
For convenience, a constructor <TT>MatrixGroup&lt; ... &gt;</TT>, which combines
these two steps, is provided.
