A <I>Coxeter system</I> is a group G with 
finite generating set S={s<sub>1</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>}, defined by the power relations 
s<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>=1 for i=1, ..., n and braid relations 
<P>
  s<sub>i</sub>s<sub>j</sub>s<sub>i</sub> ... = s<sub>j</sub>s<sub>i</sub>s<sub>j</sub> ... for i, j=1, ..., n with i&lt;j, where each side of this relation has 
length m<sub>ij</sub>&ge;2.  
Although traditionally m<sub>ij</sub>=&infin; signifies that the corresponding relation 
is omitted, for technical reasons, we use m<sub>ij</sub>=0 instead. 
Set m<sub>ji</sub>=m<sub>ij</sub> and m<sub>ii</sub>=1.  The group G is called a <I>Coxeter 
group</I> and S is
called the set of <I>Coxeter generators</I>.  
Since every group in Magma has a preferred generating set, no distinction is
made between a Coxeter system and its Coxeter group.
<P>
Due to the importance and ubiquity of Coxeter groups, a number of different 
ways of describing these groups and their reflections have been developed.
Functions for manipulating these descriptions are described in
Chapter <A  HREF = "text1068.htm#11912">COXETER SYSTEMS</A>.
<P>
Coxeter groups are usually described by a <I>Coxeter matrix</I> 
M=(m<sub>ij</sub>)<sub>i, j=1</sub><sup>n</sup>, or by a <I>Coxeter graph</I> with vertices 1, ..., n and
an edge connecting i and j labeled by m<sub>ij</sub> whenever
m<sub>ij</sub>&ge;3.
<P>
Coxeter systems are mainly important because they provide presentations for the 
real reflection groups.  A <I>Cartan matrix</I> describes a particular reflection
representation of a Coxeter group.  In certain cases, such a representation can
be described by an integer-labelled digraph, called the <I>Dynkin digraph</I>
(this is equivalent to a <I>Dynkin diagram</I>, but we have modified the
definition for technical reasons).
<P>
For finite and affine Coxeter groups, the naming system due to Cartan is also
used.  Hyperbolic Coxeter groups of degree larger than 3 are numbered.
