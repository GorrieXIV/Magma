This chapter contains Magma geometric functionality for working specifically
with algebraic surfaces and specialised subtypes. We hope to greatly 
expand this area in upcoming years. The general surface type <TT>Srfc</TT> is for
2-dimensional algebraic varieties over a field (i.e. schemes that are 
geometrically reduced and irreducible).
<P>
The current functionality is largely split between that for surfaces with serious
singularities and that for ordinary projective surfaces in
arbitrary dimensional ambients that are "almost non-singular". 
The former relies heavily on the newer desingularisation-by-blowup code (V2.21), which
applies to surfaces with a zero-dimensional singular locus, and the older formal
desingularisation package of Tobias Beck, which can handle arbitrary singularities
but is restricted to surfaces in ordinary projective 3-space of characteristic 0.
The latter relies more on Magma's coherent sheaf package. Here, almost non-singular means
that only simple (A-D-E) singularities are allowed. These are terminal singularities which
don't affect
computations involving the pluri-canonical sheaves. It is useful to allow
simple singularities as they naturally occur in a number of models
(anticanonically-embedded degenerate Del Pezzo surfaces; minimal models
for surfaces of general type).
<P>
The surface type {<TT>Srfc</TT>} is a subtype of the scheme type {<TT>Sch</TT>}
so the general functionality for schemes (see Chapter <A  HREF = "text1321.htm#14366">SCHEMES</A>) and coherent
sheaves (see Chapter <A  HREF = "text1344.htm#14850">COHERENT SHEAVES</A>) is of course also available.
<P>
The first section of the chapter deals with functions for surfaces in general
ambients although, as noted above, there are singularity assumptions and the
restriction to ordinary projective surfaces for most of the intrinsics.
The last subsection, however, covers the resolution of singularities by local
blow-ups and the functionality specifically associated with that. 
<P>
The next section deals with surfaces in Prj<sup>3</sup> with no singularity assumptions.
Here we give a full description of the formal desingularisation routines and functions
which work with either desingularisation method to compute birational invariants
of desingularisations, general adjoint linear systems, classification and reduction of
rational surfaces to special type and a general parametrization routine.
<P>
The final section deals with specific code for Del Pezzo surfaces, the specialised
subtype for which we currently have the most functionality. There are 
parametrization routines over the rationals (or number fields in some cases) for
Del Pezzos by degree and constructions for degree 6 Del Pezzos associated to
different twisted torus type. There are also minimisation and reduction
routines for degree 3 and 4 Del Pezzos and construction, point-counting
and computation of invariants for degree 3.
