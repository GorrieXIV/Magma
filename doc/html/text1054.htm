This package provides tools to work with varphi-modules over k((u))
where k is a finite field, and representations of the absolute Galois
group of k((u)) with coefficients in a finite field. The main functionality
of the package computes the semisimplification of a given varphi-module,
and the semisimplification of the Galois representation that is naturally
attached to it. In particular, the slopes of the varphi-module,
corresponding to the tame inertia weights of the Galois representation,
can be computed using this package.

Let K be a p-adic field and let G<sub>K</sub> be the absolute Galois group of K.
Representations of this group naturally arise from geometry, namely from
the p-adic {&eacute;tale cohomology of a scheme over K.
<P>
<P>
The study of these representations is a central topic in arithmetic, and
a motivation for creating this package is the following: let V be
a Q<sub>p</sub>-representation of G<sub>K</sub>, <I>i.e.</I> a Q<sub>p</sub>-vector space
endowed with a continuous, linear action of G<sub>K</sub>. Now let T &sub;V
be any Z<sub>p</sub>-lattice stable under the action of G<sub>K</sub>. There always exists
such a lattice. Moreover, the quotient T/pT has a natural structure of
F<sub>p</sub>-representation of G<sub>K</sub>. This representation depends on the choice
of T, but its semisimplification (T/pT)<sup>ss</sup> does not, according to the
Brauer-Nesbitt theorem. Recall the semisimplification of a representation
is the direct sum of the composition factors appearing in any Jordan-Holder
sequence of this representation. Therefore, it is an interesting question to
determine properties of (T/pT)<sup>ss</sup> in terms of V. Although the
Fontaine-Laffaille theory completely addresses this question for some V,
the general case remains an open question. Some computations concerning this
problem can be performed in Magma using this package.

Let k be a finite field of characteristic p, and let K = k((u)) be
the field of Laurent series with coefficients in k. Let s&ge;0
and b&ge;2 be integers. We define a "Frobenius" map &sigma; on K by
the following formula:
 &sigma;( &sum;<sub>i &isin;Z</sub> a<sub>i</sub> u<sup>i</sup>) =
&sum;<sub>i &isin;Z</sub> a<sub>i</sub><sup>p<sup>s</sup></sup>u<sup>bi</sup>.
A varphi-module over K is the data of a finite-dimensional K-vector
space D, endowed with an endomorphism varphi : D -&gt; D that
is semilinear with respect to &sigma;. This means that
for all &lambda; &isin;K, x &isin;D, we have the identity
varphi(&lambda; x) = &sigma;(&lambda;)varphi(x).
<P>
<P>
A varphi-module is said to be {&eacute;tale if the map varphi is injective.
A varphi-module can be described by the matrix representing the action of
varphi on some basis of D, and it is {&eacute;tale if and only if this matrix
is invertible.


<H4><A NAME = "11865">Classification of varphi-modules</A></H4>

<P>
<P>
<P>
Some varphi-modules play a crucial role in the theory because they
are the simple objects in the category of {&eacute;tale varphi-modules
over the maximal unramified extension K<sup>ur</sup> of K.
<P>
<P>
Let d &ge;1, h &isin;Z, &lambda; &isin;bar k. We define
the varphi-module D(d, s, &lambda;) as the varphi-module of
dimension d whose matrix in some basis is the companion matrix
of the polynomial T<sup>d</sup> - u<sup>h</sup>. We also write D(d, h) = D(d, h, 1).
Note that in general there are several ways to extend the
action of &sigma; on K<sup>ur</sup>, but we may only distinguish the cases
where &sigma; acts as identity on k, and the case where is does not.
We say that a couple (d, h) is reduced if there is no
divisor d' of d (except d) such that (b<sup>d'</sup> - 1)/(b<sup>d</sup> - 1)
is a divisor of h. The main classification results are the following:
<P>
If &sigma; != id, the simple objects of the category
of {&eacute;tale varphi-modules over K<sup>ur</sup> are the D(d, h)
for (d, h) reduced, and 
if &sigma; = id, the simple objects of the category of {&eacute;tale
varphi-modules over K<sup>ur</sup> are the D(d, h, &lambda;) for (d, h) reduced.
<P>
By definition, the slope of a simple varphi-module
isomorphic to D(d, h, &lambda;) is the rational number (h)/(b<sup>d</sup> - 1),
up to the equivalence relation "x ~y &lt;=&gt; exists
m,n &isin;N such that b<sup>m</sup> x - b<sup>n</sup>y &isin;Z". With this equivalence
relation, the definition does not depend on the choice of (d, h).
<P>
If D is a varphi-module over K, the slopes of D are the collection
of the slopes of the composition factors of K<sup>ur</sup> tensor <sub>K</sub> D (this
notion does not depend on how &sigma; is extended to K<sup>ur</sup>). Note that
even though the algorithms that we present can give decompositions over K,
for most practical uses the knowledge of the slopes should be sufficient.


<H4><A NAME = "11866">Connection with Galois Representations</A></H4>

Let us explain the link between Galois representations and varphi-modules
over K. In this section, we assume that &sigma; is the classical Frobenius
x |-&gt; x<sup>p</sup>. Let K<sup>sep</sup>  be a separable closure of K and let
G<sub>K</sub> = Gal(K<sup>sep</sup>/K) be the absolute Galois group of K.
<P>
A theorem of Katz states that there is an equivalence of categories
between the {&eacute;tale varphi-modules over K and the
F<sub>p</sub>-representations of G<sub>K</sub>.
<P>
Under this equivalence of categories, the varphi-module D(d, h)
corresponds to the "fundamental character of level d" to the power h,
&omega;<sub>d</sub><sup>h</sup>, seen as a F<sub>p</sub>-representation. The figures of h in base p
are called the tame inertia weights of the representation, because they
describe the action of the tame inertia group on the representation.
These weights can be recovered from the slope of the varphi-module.
It is worth noting that if F is a p-adic field whose residue field is k,
and F_&infin; is the extension of F generated by a compatible sequence
of p<sup>n</sup>-th roots of the uniformizer for all n, then G<sub>F_&infin;</sub> is
isomorphic to G<sub>K</sub>. Moreover, the tame inertia weights of
a F<sub>p</sub>-representation of G<sub>F</sub> are the same as the tame inertia weights
of its restriction to G<sub>F_&infin;</sub>, seen as a representation of G<sub>K</sub>.
Hence, working with varphi-modules will enable us to study representations
of p-adic Galois groups.
