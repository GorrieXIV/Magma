This chapter is about how to use Magma to compute with the Hecke
module D(N, p) of divisors on the supersingular points on X<sub>0</sub>(N) in
characteristic p.
<P>
Let p be a prime.  A divisor on the supersingular points of X<sub>0</sub>(1)
in characteristic p is a finite formal linear combination of
supersingular j-invariants j&isin;(F)<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub>.  More generally,
suppose N is an integer that is not divisible by p.  The module
D(N, p) of divisors on the supersingular points of X<sub>0</sub>(N) in
characteristic p is the free abelian group generated by 
isomorphism classes of pairs (E, C) where E is a supersingular
elliptic curve over (F)<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub> 
and C is a cyclic subgroup of E of order N.  
(We call such a pair (E, C) an elliptic curve enhanced with level N
structure.)
The abelian group D(N, p) of divisors is equipped in a natural 
way with an action of Hecke operators T<sub>n</sub>.
<P>
The module of supersingular points is a special case of the Brandt 
module construction (see Chapter <A  HREF = "text1613.htm#17887">BRANDT MODULES</A>) because of
the following equivalence between objects:

</DL>
The supersingular points of X<sub>0</sub>(N)/(F)<sub>p</sub> correspond to
singularities of the special fiber of a minimal model of X<sub>0</sub>(Np) 
at p.  This special fiber, X<sub>0</sub>(Np)/F<sub>p</sub>, is isomorphic to two 
copies of X<sub>0</sub>(N)/F<sub>p</sub> joined at the supersingular points as simple 
double points. 
The structure of the multiplicative part of the Jacobian 
J<sub>0</sub>(Np) at p is captured by the behavior of the supersingular 
points of X<sub>0</sub>(N)/F<sub>p</sub> (see Grothendieck <A  HREF = "text1622.htm#bib_groth-sga-7-I">[Gro72]</A> and 
Deligne-Rapoport <A  HREF = "text1622.htm#bib_deligne-rapoport">[DR73]</A>).  The system of Hecke 
operators on the supersingular divisor group gives a representation 
of the p-new subspace of modular forms of level Np. 
We therefore refer to the <I>level</I> of the supersingular module 
as Np, and use the term <I>auxiliary level</I> to refer to N. 
<P>
<P>
There are many reasons why one might be interested in computing with
D(N, p).  Foremost, D(N, p) is isomorphic as a module over the Hecke
algebra to a subspace of the modular forms for &Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(N) of weight
2 and level Np (more precisely, D(N, p) tensor (C) is
isomorphic to the p-new subspace of M<sub>2</sub>(&Gamma;<sub>0</sub>(Np))).  If
N=1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, then Magma computes D(N, p) using the
highly-efficient method of graphs, which for small q quickly produce
very sparse matrices that represent Hecke operators T<sub>q</sub>.  There are
also formulas of Gross, Kudla, Merel, and others that involve the
explicit representation of an eigenform in terms of a basis of
supersingular j-invariants, and Stein has a formula, which involves
D(N, p), for orders of component groups of modular abelian varieties
(see the <TT>ComponentGroupOrder</TT> command in the modular symbols 
package).
<P>
Magma computes the module of supersingular divisors using either the
method of graphs of Mestre--Oesterl&eacute; when N=1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 13  or
Brandt modules  in general. When it is applicable, the method of graphs
is much faster (in Magma) than Brandt modules, but the Brandt modules
method works in general.
<P>
The modular curve approach computes correspondences on the modular 
curves X<sub>0</sub>(N) by means of pre-computed models for the system of 
covering maps X<sub>0</sub>(N ell) -&gt; X<sub>0</sub>(N).  
Such correspondences give rise to the Hecke operators T<sub>ell</sub> 
as the adjacency matrices of the graphs of ell-isogenies of the 
basis of D(N, p). 
For the alternative approach through Brandt modules, the reader should 
consult Chapter <A  HREF = "text1613.htm#17887">BRANDT MODULES</A> and the articles of Pizer <A  HREF = "text1622.htm#bib_Pizer80">[Piz80]</A>
and Kohel <A  HREF = "text1622.htm#bib_Kohel01">[Koh01]</A>.
<P>
This package still has some unnecessary limitations.
When using Brandt modules to compute the module of supersingular
divisor in Magma, no facility is currently provided for describing the
divisors in terms of supersingular elliptic curves.  Also, it is
currently only possible to work with the module of supersingular
divisors over the integers.
