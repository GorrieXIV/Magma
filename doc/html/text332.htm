In Magma, a G-lattice L is a lattice upon which a finite integral
matrix group G acts by right multiplication. Magma allows various
computations with lattices associated with finite integral matrix groups
by use of G-lattices.
<P>
The computation of the automorphism group of a lattice (i.e. the largest
matrix group that acts on the lattice) and the testing
of lattices for isometry is performed within Magma by a 
search designed by Bill Unger, which is based on the Plesken-Souvignier
backtrack algorithm <A  HREF = "text330.htm#bib_AUTOISOM">[PS97]</A>, together with ordered partition methods.
Optionally, this may be combined with orthogonal decomposition code of
Gabi Nebe.
<P>
If G is a finite integral matrix group, then Magma uses Plesken's
centering algorithm (<A  HREF = "text330.htm#bib_Plesken_thesis">[Ple74]</A>) to construct all G-invariant sublattices of a 
given G-lattice L. The lattice of G-invariant sublattices of L can be
explored much like the lattice of submodules over finite fields.
