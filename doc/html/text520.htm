The lazy series rings <A NAME = "RngLaz"><TT>RngLaz</TT></A> and their elements <A NAME = "RngLazElt"><TT>RngLazElt</TT></A> 
allow the creation of infinite precision series by providing series for which
all coefficients can be calculated by some given formula. Only finitely
many coefficients of such a series can be known at any one time but all 
infinitely many of the coefficients are knowable. Any coefficient of a lazy 
series can be generated and once a coefficient is computed it
will be stored in the series for quick retrieval.
<P>
The simplest implementation of this idea is creating a series by providing
a map. This map is a formula for computing coefficients of a series. Given 
the exponents of the variables of a term it will give you the coefficient
of that term. Series with finitely many non--zero terms can be created
in special ways and several usual arithmetic operations can be applied 
to lazy series.
Such constructions yield lazy series with more complicated formulas
for their coefficients. 
<P>
Consider the series &sum;<sub>i = 0</sub><sup>n</sup> i * x<sup>i</sup>. A formula for the coefficients is
given by i |-&gt; i. This series can be created as a lazy series as follows:
<P>

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; L&lt;x&gt; := LazyPowerSeriesRing(Integers(), 1);
&gt; m := map&lt;Integers() -&gt; Integers() | i :-&gt; i&gt;;
&gt; s := elt&lt;L | m&gt;;
&gt; s;
Lazy power series
</PRE>
Currently s does not know what any of its coefficients are yet it is possible
to calculate any coefficient of s.
