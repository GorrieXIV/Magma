Since there is some variation between authors of the terminology 
employed in design theory, we begin with some definitions. An
<I>incidence structure</I> is a triple D = (P, B, I), where:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(a)</DT><DD>P is a set, the elements of which are called <I>points</I>;
<P>
<DT>(b)</DT><DD>B is a set, the elements of which are called <I>blocks</I>;
<P>
<DT>(c)</DT><DD>I is an incidence relation between P and B, so that
I &sub;P x B. The elements of I are called <I>flags</I>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
Usually, blocks will be subsets of P, so that instead of writing
(p, b) &isin;I, we write p &isin;b. In general, repeated blocks are 
allowed so that different blocks may correspond to the same subset
of P. If D has no repeated blocks, then we say that D is
<I>simple</I>.
<P>
An incidence structure D is said to be <I>uniform</I> with
<I>blocksize</I> k if D has at least one block and all blocks
contain exactly k points.
A uniform incidence structure is called <I>trivial</I> if each
k-subset of the point set appears as a block (at least once).
<P>
Let t &ge;0 be an integer. Then
an incidence structure D is said to be t--<I>balanced</I> if there exists
an integer &lambda; &ge;1 such that each t--subset of the point set
is contained in exactly &lambda; blocks of D.
<P>
A <I>near--linear space</I> is an incidence structure in which every 
block contains at least two points and any two points lie in at most
one block. A <I>linear space</I> is a near--linear space in which any 
two points lie in <I>exactly</I> one block. It is usual, when discussing 
near--linear spaces, to use the term <I>line</I> in place of the term 
<I>block</I>.
<P>
Let v, k, t and &lambda; be integers with v &ge;k &ge;t &ge;0
and &lambda; &ge;1. A t--<I>design</I> with v points and
<I>blocksize</I> k is an incidence structure D = (P, B, I) where:
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(a)</DT><DD>The cardinality of P is v;
<P>
<DT>(b)</DT><DD>D is uniform with blocksize k;
<P>
<DT>(c)</DT><DD>D is simple;
<P>
<DT>(d)</DT><DD>For each t--subset T of P there are exactly &lambda; blocks of B incident with all the points of T (so D is t--balanced).
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
Such a design is usually referred to as a t--(v, k, &lambda;) design.
The parameter &lambda; is called the <I>index</I> of the design.
If b denotes the cardinality of B, a t--design with v = b and
t &ge;2 is called a <I>symmetric design</I>.
A t--design with &lambda; = 1 is called a <I>Steiner design</I>.
A design which is trivial is also called a <I>complete design</I>.
Note that a design D must contain at least one block (i.e b &gt; 0).
<P>
The category names for the different families of incidence structures
are as follows:
