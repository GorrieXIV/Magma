<P>
<P>
Some terminology will be useful. It is perhaps best to read this section only
briefly, and to refer back to it when necessary.
<P>
The term <I>expression</I> will be used to refer to a textual entity. The term
<I>value</I> will be used to refer to a run-time value denoted by an expression.
To understand the difference between an expression and a value consider the 
expressions <TT>1+2</TT> and <TT>3</TT>. The expressions are textually different but they 
denote the same value, namely the integer 3.
<P>
A <I>function expression</I> is any expression of the form <TT>function ... end function</TT>
or of the form <TT>func&lt; ... | ... &gt;</TT>. The former type of function expression will
be said to be <I>in the statement form</I>, the latter <I>in the expression
form</I>.
A <I>function value</I> is the run-time value denoted
by a function expression. As with integers, two function expressions can
be textually different while denoting the same (i.e., extensionally equal) 
function value. To clearly distinguish function values from function 
expressions, the notation FUNC( ... : ...  ) will
be used to describe function 
<I>values</I>.
<P>
The <I>formal arguments</I> of a function in the statement form are the identifiers 
that appear between the brackets just after the <TT>function</TT> keyword, while
for a function in the expression form they are the identifiers 
that appear before the <TT>|</TT>. The <I>arguments</I> to a function 
are the expressions between the brackets when a function is applied.
<P>
The <I>body</I> of a function in the statement form is the statements after the
formal arguments. The body of a function in the expression form is the
expression after the <TT>|</TT> symbol.
<P>
An identifier is said to occur <I>inside</I> a function expression when
it is occurs textually anywhere in the body of a function.
