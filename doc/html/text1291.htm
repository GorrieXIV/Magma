In this section we list various attributes of invariant rings which can
be examined and set by the user.  This allows low-level control of
information stored in invariant rings or fields.  Note that when the user sets
an attribute, only minimal testing can be done on the value so if an
incorrect value is set, unpredictable results may occur.  Note also
that if an attribute is not set, referring to it in an expression
(using the ` operator)
will <I>not</I> trigger the calculation of it (while intrinsic functions
do); rather an error will ensue.  Use the <TT>assigned</TT> operator
to test whether an attribute is set.


<H5><A NAME = "14028">R`PrimaryInvariants</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The attribute for the primary invariants of invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>.  If
the attribute <TT>R`PrimaryInvariants</TT> is examined, either the current
primary invariants of R are set so they are returned or an error results.
If the attribute <TT>R`PrimaryInvariants</TT> is set by assignment,
it must be sequence of n algebraically-independent invariants of G,
where n is the rank of R.  Magma will not necessarily check
that this condition is met since that may be very time-consuming.  If
the attribute is already set, the new value must be the same as the old value.
Note that this attribute is useful when it is desired to compute secondary
invariants of R with respect to some specially constructed primary
invariants which would not be constructed by the automatic algorithm
in Magma.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14029">R`SecondaryInvariants</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The attribute for the secondary invariants of invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>.  If
the attribute <TT>R`SecondaryInvariants</TT> is examined, either the current
primary invariants of R are set so they are returned or an error results.
If the attribute <TT>R`SecondaryInvariants</TT> is set by assignment to Q,
primary invariants for R must already be defined, and Q must be
sequence of secondary invariants with respect to the primary invariants
of R.
Magma will not necessarily check
that this condition is met since that may be very time-consuming.  If
the attribute is already set, the new value must be the same as the old value.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14030">R`HilbertSeries</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The attribute for the Hilbert series of invariant ring R=K[V]<sup>G</sup>.  If
the attribute <TT>R`HilbertSeries</TT> is examined, either the
Hilbert series of R is computed so it is returned or an error results.
If the attribute <TT>R`HilbertSeries</TT> is set by assignment to H,
H must be rational function in the function field Z(t) and equal
to the Hilbert series of R.
Magma will not necessarily check
that this condition is met since that may be very time-consuming.  If
the attribute is already set, the new value must be the same as the old value.
