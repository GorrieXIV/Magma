The functions in this chapter handle basic descriptions of Coxeter systems. 
A <I>Coxeter system</I> is a group G with 
finite generating set S={s<sub>1</sub>, ..., s<sub>n</sub>}, defined by relations s<sub>i</sub><sup>2</sup>=1 for
i=1, ..., n and 
<P>
  s<sub>i</sub>s<sub>j</sub>s<sub>i</sub> ... = s<sub>j</sub>s<sub>i</sub>s<sub>j</sub> ... for i, j=1, ..., n with i&lt;j, where each side of this relation has 
length m<sub>ij</sub>&ge;2.  
Traditionally, m<sub>ij</sub>=&infin; signifies that the corresponding relation is
omitted but for technical reasons m<sub>ij</sub>=0 is used in Magma instead. 
The group G is called a <I>Coxeter group</I> and S is
called the set of <I>Coxeter generators</I>.  
Since every group in Magma has a preferred generating set, no distinction 
is made between a Coxeter system and its Coxeter group.  See <A  HREF = "text1067.htm#bib_BourbakiLie">[Bou68]</A> 
for more details on the theory of Coxeter groups.
<P>
The <I>rank</I> of the Coxeter system is n=|S|.
A Coxeter system is said to be <I>reducible</I>
if there is a proper subset I of {1, ..., n} such that m<sub>ij</sub>=2
or m<sub>ji</sub>=2 whenever i&isin;I and j&notin;I.  
In this case, G is an (internal) direct product 
of the Coxeter subgroups W<sub>I</sub>=&lt; s<sub>i</sub> | i &isin;I &gt; and
W<sub>I<sup>c</sup></sub>=&lt; s<sub>i</sub> | i &notin;I &gt;.  
Note that an <I>irreducible</I> Coxeter group may still be a nontrivial direct
product of abstract subgroups (for example, W(G<sub>2</sub>) isomorphic to S<sub>2</sub> x S<sub>3</sub>).
Two Coxeter systems are <I>Coxeter isomorphic</I> (or <I>graph isomorphic</I>)
if there is a group isomorphism between them which takes Coxeter generators 
to Coxeter generators.  In other words, the two groups are the same modulo 
renumbering of the generators.

Coxeter groups and their representations as reflection groups have a
number of useful descriptions.  In this chapter, Coxeter matrices, 
Coxeter graphs, Cartan matrices, and Dynkin digraphs will be discussed. 
The classification of finite and affine Coxeter groups provides a naming 
system for these groups.  In
Chapters <A  HREF = "text1079.htm#12000">ROOT SYSTEMS</A> and <A  HREF = "text1089.htm#12115">ROOT DATA</A>, finite root systems
and root data, which provide a more detailed description of finite
Coxeter groups, are discussed.  Coxeter groups themselves are discussed
in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1101.htm#12331">COXETER GROUPS</A>;  reflection
representations of Coxeter groups are discussed in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1118.htm#12530">REFLECTION GROUPS</A>.
