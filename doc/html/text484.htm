Since p-adic rings are completions (like the real
numbers), it is difficult to represent their elements in an exact form.  As
described in Section <A  HREF = "text483.htm#5220">Background</A>, any element x of a local ring
L can be expressed as a power series in the uniformizing element of L.
Most problems
can be solved by computing in a finite quotient of L, which is equivalent to
truncating the infinite expansion of x at some point. More precisely, we work
in the quotient rings L / &pi;<sup>k</sup> L for non-negative k, which is called the
<I>precision</I> of the ring L.
<P>
Unfortunately, working with finite approximations to elements does have
problems.  Some operations on these approximations will yield results with
reduced precision.  For example, in a ring constructed with precision k the
quotient of two elements with valuations v<sub>1</sub> &ge;v<sub>2</sub> lies in the local ring,
but can only be determined up to k - v<sub>2</sub> digits.  Also, it is only possible
in general to construct an approximation to the GCD of two polynomials f and
g over a local ring.
<P>
Magma offers two models for computing in a local ring L.  The first model
(the <I>fixed precision model</I>) allows the user to work with the quotient
rings defined above.  These quotient rings are finite structures, and their
elements can easily be represented exactly; hence, many exact algorithms can be
applied to them.  On the other hand, precision management is left to the user,
since operations which may lose precision, such as division, will still return
results to the full precision of the ring.  In the second model (the <I>free
precision model</I>), the user works more directly with L, instead of a finite
quotient of L.  Each element is still represented by a finite approximation,
however, these approximations can be of varying precisions, thus freeing the
user from precision management.  However, these rings are inexact (for
instance, there is no zero element of the ring, only approximations to it), and
hence many algorithms in Magma which are designed for exact rings may cause
significant precision loss.  The situation is analogous to the support for real
numbers in Magma.

A local field in Magma is the field of fractions of a local ring.
Representing a local field on a machine causes some trouble, since there is no
algebraic structure in which truncations of the elements could be interpreted
(as in the case of the finite quotients for the local rings).  Moreover, all
structural information of a local field is already contained in its ring of
integers, so that the main motivation for supporting local fields is to provide
some basic arithmetic.
<P>
An element x of a local field L is stored internally as x = &pi;<sup>v</sup> u +
O(&pi;<sup>v + k</sup>), where v is the (possibly negative) valuation of x, and u
is a unit known to precision k in the ring of integers of L.  It can
happen that operations in a field yield elements with no known digits at all,
since the unit parts may not overlap.

Free precision rings and fields can be created with bounded or unbounded
precision.  If they are created with some bounded precision k, then no
element in the structure can have precision greater than k.  Thus, bounded
free precision rings are "inexact" versions of the fixed precision rings.
Unbounded precision structures can have elements with arbitrarily large, but
not infinite, precision.  In general, it is recommended that free precision
structures are utilized unless speed is absolutely critical.

In Magma, all measurements of precision are made with respect to a valuation
function v<sub>&pi;</sub> which takes the uniformizer &pi; of the local ring L to
unity (throughout this chapter, the subscript will be dropped on v<sub>&pi;</sub>
where there is no ambiguity).  This can have surprising results.  For instance,
consider a local ring L<sub>1</sub> which extends L<sub>2</sub>, such that the ramification
degree of L<sub>1</sub> over L<sub>2</sub> is e.  Let &pi;<sub>1</sub> and &pi;<sub>2</sub> be the
uniformizing elements of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>, respectively.  Then,
v_(&pi;<sub>1</sub>)(&pi;<sub>1</sub>) = 1, and v_(&pi;<sub>1</sub>)(&pi;<sub>2</sub>) = e.  Hence, an element
of precision k in L<sub>2</sub> will have precision ek in when mapped into
L<sub>1</sub>.  Thus, it is important to always remember in which ring precision is
determined.
