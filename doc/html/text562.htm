This package provides functionality for working with Galois representations 
<P>
  Gal(bar(K)/K) -&gt; GL<sub>m</sub>(C)
<P>
over p-adic fields K (type <TT>FldPad</TT>). 
The representations we consider are precisely those on the `Galois side' 
of the local Langlands correspondence, or, technically, the 
<I>Frobenius-semisimple Weil-Deligne representations</I> over K. 
We refer the reader to Tate's article <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79, Para 4]</A> for their 
basic properties.
<P>
In arithmetic geometry, such representations arise from 
l-adic &eacute;tale cohomology of algebraic varieties over K for l&ne;p. 
Magma includes Galois representations that come from finite Galois groups 
of p-adic extensions, local components of Dirichlet characters 
and Artin representations, local Galois representations coming from a Tate module 
of an elliptic curve or a modular form, as well as various constructions 
to produce new representations from existing ones, such as 
direct sums, tensor products, induction, restriction and semisimplification.

Suppose K is a finite extension of Q<sub>p</sub>, with ring of integers O, maximal 
ideal m and residue field k=O/m isomorphic to F<sub>q</sub>. 
The absolute Galois group of K fits into an exact sequence 1 -&gt; I_K -&gt; Gal(bar{K}/K) -&gt; Gal(bar k/k) -&gt; 1,    &sigma; |-&gt; &sigma;mod m 
where I<sub>K</sub> is the <I>inertia group</I> of K. The group Gal(bar k/k)
is topologically generated by the automorphism x |-&gt; x<sup>q</sup>, and 
any of its lifts to Gal(bar(K)/K) is called an 
<I>arithmetic Frobenius element</I>, denoted Frob<sub>K</sub>. 
<P>
The <I>Weil group W<sub>K</sub> of K</I> is a subgroup of Gal(bar(K)/K) generated by the
inertia group I<sub>K</sub> and any Frobenius element. It fits in the same exact 
sequence as above, except that the profinite group Gal(bar k/k) isomorphic to hatZ 
is replaced by a copy of Z with discrete topology. 
A <I>Weil representation</I> is a continuous representation
<P>
  &rho;: W<sub>K</sub> -&gt; GL<sub>m</sub>(C).
<P>
By continuity, the image of inertia &rho;(I<sub>K</sub>) is finite, and &rho; is said
to be <I>unramified</I> if it is trivial. We will always assume that 
&rho; is <I>Frobenius-semisimple</I>, that is &rho;(Frob<sub>K</sub>) is a semisimple
endomorphism of C<sup>m</sup>. Every such representation &rho; is 
a direct sum of irreducible representations of the form
<P>
  &psi; tensor R,
<P>
where &psi;: I<sub>K</sub> |-&gt; 1, Frob<sub>K</sub> |-&gt; &alpha;&isin;C<sup> x </sup>
is an unramified 1-dimensional character (uniquely determined by 
&alpha;&isin;C<sup> x </sup>) and R is a representation of Gal(F/K)
for some finite Galois extension F/K.
<P>
Weil representations occur naturally as local components of Artin 
representations, and as representations associated to (H<sup>1</sup> of) elliptic curves
and abelian varieties over K with potentially good reduction. 
(By the N&eacute;ron-Ogg-Shafarevich criterion, potentially good reduction 
is <I>equivalent</I> to &rho;(I<sub>K</sub>) being finite.) 
To deal with arbitrary reduction behaviour one considers,
more generally, <I>Weil-Deligne</I> representations. These come from
Galois representations
<P>
  &rho;: Gal(bar(K)/K) -&gt; GL<sub>m</sub>(C)
<P>
that can be described as follows.
<P>
As before, &rho; is a direct sum of indecomposable representations,
and an indecomposable one is now of the form (cf. <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79, 4.1.5]</A>)
<P>
  &rho; = &psi; tensor SP(n) tensor R,
<P>
with &psi; and R as above, and SP(n) is
a `special' representation (<A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79, 4.1.4]</A>),
<P>
  SP(n) = C e<sub>0</sub> + C e<sub>1</sub> + ... + C e<sub>n - 1</sub>.
<P>
The e<sub>i</sub> are eigenvectors for Frob<sub>K</sub> with eigenvalues q<sup> - i</sup>, and the 
action of inertia is nilpotent, and represented by a matrix N 
(see <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79, 4.1.2]</A>) that takes e<sub>i</sub> |-&gt; e<sub>i + 1</sub> and e<sub>n - 1</sub> |-&gt; 0. 
<P>
This is precisely how Galois representations are stored in Magma, 
<P>
  &rho; = bigoplus<sub>i</sub>  &psi;<sub>i</sub> tensor SP(n<sub>i</sub>) tensor R<sub>i</sub>,
<P>
except that it is convenient to 
<P>
(1) assume that all R<sub>i</sub> factor through the same Galois group G=Gal(F/K), and
<P>
(2) allow &psi;<sub>i</sub> to be arbitrary unramified representations,
    not necessarily 1-dimensional. Such a &psi; is a sum of unramified 
    characters &chi;<sub>j</sub>: Frob<sub>K</sub> |-&gt; &alpha;<sub>j</sub>, and &psi; is uniquely determined
    by its <I>Euler factor</I>
<P>
      &Psi;(T) = det (1 - Frob<sub>K</sub><sup> - 1</sup>T|&psi;) = &prod;<sub>j</sub> (1 - &alpha;<sub>j</sub><sup> - 1</sup> T) &isin;C[T].
<P>
<P>
In other words, every component of &rho; can be represented 
(though not quite uniquely) by a triple
&lt; &Psi;, n, c &gt;, where &Psi;&isin;C[T], n&isin;Z and c is a 
character of a representation R of a finite group Gal(F/K). 
Throughout the chapter we will refer to R as the `finite part' of 
an indecomposable representation &psi; tensor SP(n) tensor R, though it depends 
on the choice of such a presentation.
<P>
Galois representations have Magma type <TT>GalRep</TT>. The 
base field K, field F, the Galois group F/K, and the list of components
of &rho; can be obtained with <TT>BaseField</TT>, <TT>Field</TT>, <TT>Group</TT> and
<TT>Factorization</TT>, respectively.

There are various choices of signs in local class field theory, for which there
appears to be no consensus in the literature. Our conventions follow Tate
<A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79]</A>, and are as follows.
(We refer the reader to Tate's article <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79]</A> for the definitions
and properties of Weil-Deligne representations,
and <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79]</A>, <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_deligne-rootnumber">[Del79]</A> for their &epsilon;-factors.)
<P>
For a p-adic field K with ring of integers O, uniformizer &pi; and 
residue field F<sub>q</sub>,
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="closed.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>  
A Frobenius element Frob<sub>K</sub> is an arithmetic Frobenius, i.e. acts 
as x |-&gt; x<sup>q</sup> on the residue field (<B>not</B> x |-&gt; x<sup>1/q</sup>).
<P>
<IMG SRC="closed.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>  
The local reciprocity map &theta;: K<sup> x </sup>to Gal(bar K/K)<sup>ab</sup> takes
&pi; to Frob<sub>K</sub><sup> - 1</sup> (<B>not</B> Frob<sub>K</sub>).
<P>
<IMG SRC="closed.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>  
The local epsilon-factors &epsilon;(&chi;)=&epsilon;(&chi;, &psi;, dx) rely implicitly
on the choice of a measure dx on O and an additive character &psi;: K to C. 
Our choices are that dx is normalized, int<sub>O</sub> dx=1, and 
<P>
  &psi;(x) = exp bigl(2&pi; i Tr<sub>K/Q<sub>p</sub></sub>(x)bigr),
<P>
viewing Tr<sub>K/Q<sub>p</sub></sub>(x)&isin;Q<sub>p</sub> as any rational number a/p<sup>n</sup>&isin;Q 
in the same class mod Z<sub>p</sub>. Finally, for 1-dimensional ramified &chi;, the 
formula for &epsilon;(&chi;) is as in <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Tate">[Tat79, 3.2.6.2]</A>,
<P>
  &epsilon;(&chi;) = int_(c<sup> - 1</sup> O<sup> x </sup>) &chi;<sup> - 1</sup>(&theta;(x)) &psi;(x),
<P>
with
<P>
  v<sub>K</sub>(c) = v<sub>K</sub>((Conductor)(&chi;)) + v<sub>p</sub>((Discriminant)(O, Z<sub>p</sub>)).
<P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="closed.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7>  
Euler factors of global Artin representations A (and of Dirichlet 
characters) are <I>the same</I> (<B>not</B> complex conjugate) as 
the local ones: 
<P>
hfil<TT>EulerFactor(A,p) = EulerFactor(GaloisRepresentation(A,p))</TT>.hfil
<P>
<P>
As the Artin L-function L(A, s) is defined using arithmetic Frobenius and 
Galois representations using geometric Frobenius, this means that the Galois
representation <TT>GaloisRepresentation(A,p)</TT> comes from the Galois 
action on the <I>dual</I> vector space of A.

Galois representations attached to Artin representations are computed 
using the machinery of <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_DDFrob13">[DD13]</A>.
Galois representations coming from elliptic curves rely partly
on the theory of reconstructing representations from their Euler
factors <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_DDWeil15">[DD15]</A> (see Para<A  HREF = "text568.htm#6084">Example: Reconstructing a Galois Representation from its Euler Factors</A>), and 
Rachel Newton's tame local reciprocity formula <A  HREF = "text560.htm#bib_Newton2012">[New12]</A>.
