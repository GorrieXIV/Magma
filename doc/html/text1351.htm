This subsection describes tests for several important properties of coherent
sheaves. It contains an isomorphism test that, combined with <A  HREF = "text1350.htm#shf:div-to-shf">DivisorToSheaf</A>,
can be used as a test for linear equivalence of Cartier divisors.

Given a sheaf S on ordinary projective scheme X, this function returns 
<TT>true</TT> if and only if S is a locally free sheaf on X of constant rank
and, if so, also returns its rank.
<P>
Our original implementation was very fast but unfortunately incorrect!
We have modified it to the algorithm described below which uses an
"{&eacute;tale stratification" of X.
<P>
The more straightforward method
uses Fitting ideals of the module M (or M<sub>max</sub>) of S. If the
possible rank is d (as determined from Hilbert polynomials),
it is required to check that the saturation of the dth Fitting
ideal is the full ring and that the (d - 1)th lies in the
saturated ideal of X. This is now the default method, but can be
extremely slow and use a large amount of memory. Our alternative
method is much slower than it was but we still find that it can be much faster than
the Fitting ideal method for a low dimensional X in a high dimensional ambient
and a sheaf S whose (maximal) module has a presentation with a 
reasonably large minimal number of both generators and relations.
<P>
To use the alternative method, the user can set the <TT>UseFitting</TT> parameter to <TT>false</TT>.
For this method, it is assumed that X is equidimensional (all of its primary components have 
the same dimension), (locally) Cohen-Macaulay and connected. Magma
does not check these conditions. The alternative method is described below.
<P>
The equidimensional and locally Cohen-Macaulay assumptions imply that 
X is faithfully flat over P<sub>0</sub> = Proj(R<sub>0</sub>) for a Noether normalisation
R<sub>0</sub> of the coordinate ring of X. Standard flatness 
properties mean that S being locally free over X implies that it is locally 
free as a sheaf over P<sub>0</sub>, which is just a full projective space. 
Serre's criterion (see <A  HREF = "text1343.htm#bib_serre_sheaves">[Ser55]</A>) states that the latter is true if 
and only if all intermediate cohomology rings H<sup>i</sup>(P<sub>0</sub>, S(q)) vanish for 
q ll 0. If M<sub>max</sub> is the maximal graded module of S, this translates 
to all intermediate Ext(M<sub>max</sub>, R<sub>0</sub>) R<sub>0</sub>-modules being finite length, 
which in turn translates to the dual complex to the minimal free resolution 
of M<sub>max</sub> as an R<sub>0</sub>-module, having finite-length homology groups at all 
intermediate places. Rather than actually computing homology modules,
we can further translate this condition into a number of equality tests for Hilbert 
polynomials of cokernels of the maps between free modules in the dual complex. This
operation seems to be fairly fast and efficient in practice.
<P>
The above gives a necessary condition for local freeness over X (and gives the rank)
but it is only sufficient over the Zariski open subset of X over which X -&gt; P<sub>0</sub> is unramified. We have adapted it to be applied inductively over a chain of 
closed subschemes of X, which is what we refer to as the {&eacute;tale stratification
of X. At each level, we have a subscheme Y of X and a possibly empty
collection of polynomials {F<sub>i</sub>} which are non-zero divisors on Y and such that
a chosen Noether normalisation of Y is unramified (equivalently, {&eacute;tale)
outside of the subschemes Y<sub>i</sub> defined by F<sub>i</sub> adjoined to the equations of Y.
These subschemes lie at the next level down. The conditions imply that all of the
Y<sub>i</sub> are equidimensional and Cohen-Macaulay. For Y<sub>i</sub> of positive dimension,
we apply the above test to the restriction of S to Y<sub>i</sub>, checking that the 
rank is the same as the rank determined for X at the top level if the test is
passed and also that F<sub>i</sub> is not a zero-divisor on the module of the restricted sheaf.
For Y<sub>i</sub> of dimension 0, we perform a more direct test.
<P>
The overall algorithm generally takes much longer than just applying the main test
to X. The {&eacute;tale stratification can take some time to compute when
X lies in higher dimensional ambients. However, the main problem is that
the degrees of the Y<sub>i</sub> increase as we go down the chain (the subscheme
defined by F<sub>i</sub> has the degree of Y<sub>i</sub> multiplied by the degree of F<sub>i</sub>
as its degree) and in practice (mainly working with surfaces X), the
most time is taken in the bottom level checks on high degree zero-dimensional
subschemes.
Once computed, the {&eacute;tale stratification is stored with X, so does not 
need to be recomputed for tests on other sheaves.
However, it relies on finding Noether normalisations at each level that are
generically unramified, i.e. separable. Currently we do not check the condition 
and it can fail in small positive characteristic leading to a crash or wrong 
results.

<H5>IsIsomorphicWithTwist(S, T) : ShfCoh, ShfCoh -&gt; BoolElt, RngIntElt, ShfHom</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
For S and T coherent sheaves on the same base scheme X, this function
returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if S is isomorphic to T or (for the second 
intrinsic) to a Serre twist T(d) of T. In either case, an isomorphism is
returned, if one exists and for the second intrinsic, the twist d is also 
returned as the second return value (so the isomorphism is between S and T(d)).
<P>
For the implementation, we first do a quick Hilbert polynomial check and then a
Betti number check for the maximal modules M<sub>max</sub> and N<sub>max</sub> of S and T.
This gives necessary conditions for an isomorphism and the possible d in the
"with twist" case. Then we look for an isomorphism in the finite dimensional 
space of homomorphisms between M<sub>max</sub> and N<sub>max</sub>. We could have chosen to 
work with the homomorphisms between the truncated modules with gradings greater
than or equal to N, for some N greater than or equal to the regularity of 
any defining modules for the two sheaves, but these have much larger presentations 
in general so the computation of homomorphisms is slower.
<P>
To look for isomorphisms, we look at the "zero degree" subblocks of the matrices
giving a basis to the space of all homomorphisms. This reduces the problem to
determining whether there is an invertible matrix in a space of n x n matrices
over the base field. This is known to be a difficult problem in general and 
currently our implementation is rather weak at this point. We hope to improve 
it for future releases.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sheaf S on an ordinary projective scheme X, this function returns 
<TT>true</TT> if and only if the maximal graded module M<sub>max</sub> of S is a 
Cohen-Macaulay module over the coordinate ring of X.
<P>
A scheme X is called arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay if and only if its 
coordinate ring is a Cohen-Macaulay ring. This is then true if and only if 
its coordinate ring is equal to the maximal module of OX and the 
intrinsic returns <TT>true</TT> for OX.
<P>
This is a fairly straightforward computation once M<sub>max</sub> has been determined.
If we already know the structure of M<sub>max</sub> as a module over a Noether
normalisation of the coordinate ring of X, it is an immediate freeness
check. Otherwise it is a straightforward depth calculation from a minimal
free resolution of M<sub>max</sub> as a graded module over the coordinate ring of
the ambient of X.
