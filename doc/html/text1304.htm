A differential ideal I&sub;R of a differential ring R is an ideal of 
R that is closed under the derivation of R.
However, we consider a differential ideal as an ideal of the 
underlying ring of R.
More specifically,
ideals of differential rings are restricted to those rings
whose underlying rings are multivariate polynomial rings.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sequence L with entries in a differential ring R, return
the differential ideal generated by the entries of L as an ideal 
of the underlying ring of R.
The underlying ring of R must be of type <TT>RngMPol</TT>.
At first the elements of L may generate an ideal
which is not closed under the derivation of R.
By adding as many derivatives of the elements to the set of generators 
of the ideal as needed, one obtains
a full set of generators for the calculated differential ideal.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a differential ring R and a differential ideal I,
return the differential quotient ring Q=R/I.
The derivation of Q is induced by the derivation of R.
It maps Q.i to Q ! &delta;<sub>R</sub>(R.i), for
i=1, 2, ..., m where m is the number of generators of Q (or R).
The induced quotient map from R to Q is also returned.
