Let V be a vector space of dimension n over a field K. 
If &sigma; is an automorphism of K, a &sigma;-sesquilinear form
on the vector space V over K is a map &beta; : V x V to K such that
eqalignno(
  &beta;(u<sub>1</sub> + u<sub>2</sub>, v) &amp;= &beta;(u<sub>1</sub>, v) + &beta;(u<sub>2</sub>, v), cr
  &beta;(u, v<sub>1</sub> + v<sub>2</sub>) &amp;= &beta;(u, v<sub>1</sub>) + &beta;(u, v<sub>2</sub>)cr noalign(rlap(and))
  &beta;(au, bv) &amp;= a&sigma;(b)&beta;(u, v).)
<P>
for all u, u<sub>1</sub>, u<sub>2</sub>, v, v<sub>1</sub>, v<sub>2</sub>&isin;V and all a, b&isin;K.  If &sigma; is the
identity, the form is said to be <I>bilinear</I>.
<P>
A linear transformation g of V is an <I>isometry</I> if g preserves
&beta;; it is a <I>similarity</I> if it preserves &beta; up to a non-zero
scalar multiple.
<P>
A &sigma;-sesquilinear form &beta; is <I>reflexive</I> if for all u, v&isin;V,
<P>
&beta;(u, v) = 0 implies &beta;(v, u) = 0.  Any non-zero multiple of a 
reflexive form is again reflexive with the same group of isometries. By a 
theorem of Brauer <A  HREF = "text290.htm#bib_brauer-1936">[Bra36]</A> (but sometimes referred to as the 
Birkhoff--von Neumann theorem), up to a non-zero scalar multiple, there are 
three types of <I>non-degenerate</I> reflexive forms:
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT></DT><DD><B>Alternating.</B> In this case &sigma; is the identity,
    &beta;(u, u) = 0 for all u&isin;V and consequently &beta;(u, v) =
    - &beta;(v, u) for all u, v &isin;V.  The group of isometries is a
    <I>symplectic</I> group.
<DT></DT><DD><B>Symmetric.</B> In this case &sigma; is the identity and
    &beta;(u, v) = &beta;(v, u) for all u, v &isin;V.  If the characteristic
    of K is not two, the group of isometries is an <I>orthogonal</I> 
    group.  If the characteristic is two, the form is either alternating
    or pseudo-alternating (see below).
<DT></DT><DD><B>Hermitian.</B> In this case &sigma; is an automorphism of
    order two and &beta;(u, v) = &sigma;&beta;(v, u) for all u, v &isin;V.
    The group of isometries is a <I>unitary</I> group.
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
If V is a vector space V and if &beta; is a reflexive form defined on V, 
the partially ordered set of totally isotropic subspaces with respect to 
&beta; is often referred to as a 
<P>
<I>polar space</I>. Similarly, there are polar spaces associated with
quadratic forms (see Section <A  HREF = "text293.htm#2698">Quadratic Forms</A>).  But throughout this
chapter by polar space we shall simply mean a vector space furnished with 
either a reflexive &sigma;-sesquilinear form or a quadratic form.  
See <A  HREF = "text290.htm#bib_buekenhout95">[Bue95, Chap. 2]</A> for an account of polar spaces in a more 
general context.
<P>
Let K<sub>0</sub> be the fixed field of &sigma;.  Multiplying an alternating, 
symmetric or hermitian form by a non-zero element of K<sub>0</sub> leaves the
type of the form unchanged.
<P>
However, multiplying an hermitian form by a non-zero element of K produces
a sesquilinear form &xi; and an element &epsilon;&isin;K such that 
for all u, v &isin;V, &xi;(v, u) = &epsilon;&sigma;&xi;(u, v), where 
&epsilon;&sigma;(&epsilon;) = 1. In this case &xi; is said to be 
&epsilon;-hermitian.
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT></DT><DD><B>Skew-hermitian.</B> A reflexive &sigma;-sesquilinear form is
    skew-hermitian if the order of &sigma; is two and &xi;(v, u) = 
    - &sigma;&xi;(v, u) for all u, v&isin;V.  If &beta; is hermitian and if 
    d&isin;K is chosen so that d&ne;&sigma;(d), then e = d - &sigma;(d) 
    satisfies &sigma;(e) = - e.   Thus &xi;(u, v) = e&beta;(u, v) is 
    skew-hermitian.  The group of isometries of &xi; coincides with the
    group of isometries of &beta; and it is therefore a <I>unitary</I> group.
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
In the case of fields of characteristic two there is no distinction between
hermitian and skew-hermitian forms and moreover, every alternating form is
symmetric.
<P>
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT></DT><DD><B>Pseudo-alternating.</B> A symmetric form (in characteristic two) 
which is not alternating is said to be <I>pseudo-alternating</I>.
<P>
<P>
<P>
</DL>
The three types of forms---alternating, symmetric and hermitian---correspond to 
the three types of classical groups of isometries: symplectic, orthogonal and 
unitary. But this is not quite the whole story because it does not include 
orthogonal groups over fields of characteristic two. In order to include these 
groups it is necessary to consider quadratic forms in addition to symmetric 
bilinear forms.

If &beta; is a bilinear form, a <I>quadratic form</I> with <I>polar form</I>
<P>
&beta; is a function Q : V to K such that
eqalignno(
  Q(av) &amp;= a<sup>2</sup>Q(v)cr noalign(rlap(and))
  &beta;(u, v) &amp;= Q(u + v) - Q(u) - Q(v))
<P>
for all u, v&isin;V and all a&isin;K.  We have &beta;(v, v) = 2Q(v) and
therefore, if the characteristic of K is not two, &beta; determines Q.
<P>
We extend the notion of polar space to include vector spaces V with an 
associated quadratic form Q.  The pair (V, Q) is an orthogonal geometry
and V is a <I>quadratic</I> space.
