As noted in the introduction, for the basics on multivariate polynomial rings and 
their elements, including their creation, the user should refer to
Chapter <A  HREF = "text222.htm#1912">MULTIVARIATE POLYNOMIAL RINGS</A>. For creation of polynomial rings with non-default
(currently lexicographic) monomial ordering, the user should refer to
 Chapter <A  HREF = "text1203.htm#13438">GR&Ouml;BNER BASES</A>. Similarly, the basic creation functions for ideals
and additional basis options are described in Chapter <A  HREF = "text1203.htm#13438">GR&Ouml;BNER BASES</A>.
The commonest creation methods are the <A  HREF = "text1206.htm#GB:ideal">ideal</A> constructor and
the <A  HREF = "text1206.htm#GB:Ideal">Ideal</A> function.
