Let k be a field of characteristic different from 2. We consider a curve of
genus 2, given by an equation
C:y<sup>2</sup>=f(x)
where f(x) is a square-free polynomial of degree 5 or 6. Let J be the
Jacobian of C. In this section we mean by a <I>Richelot isogeny</I> a polarized
isogeny &Phi;: J -&gt; A between principally polarized abelian surfaces, such
that the kernel of &Phi; over the algebraic closure has group structure
Z/2Z x Z/2Z. We have that J[&Phi;]&sub;J[2] is maximal isotropic
with respect to the Weil-pairing on J[2].
<P>
We can represent the points of J[&Phi;] over the algebraic closure as divisors
in the following way. We write
f(x)=cQ<sub>1</sub>(x)Q<sub>2</sub>(x)Q<sub>3</sub>(x),
where the Q<sub>i</sub> are degree 2 polynomials if deg(f)=6. If deg(f)=5 then
Q<sub>2</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub> are of degree 2 and Q<sub>1</sub> is of degree
1 and is considered to represent a degree 2 with a root at x=&infin;.
Then
{0, [Q<sub>1</sub>(x)=0] - [Q<sub>2</sub>(x)=0], [Q<sub>1</sub>(x)=0] - [Q<sub>3</sub>(x)=0],
 [Q<sub>2</sub>(x)=0] - [Q<sub>3</sub>(x)=0] }
is the kernel of some Richelot-isogeny and, conversely, any Richelot kernel can
be represented in this way.
<P>
The Q<sub>i</sub> do not have to be defined over the ground field individually. One way
of specifying such a kernel is to write
f(x)=c(Norm)<sub>L[x]/k[x]</sub> Q(x)
where L=k[t]/(h(t)) for some square free cubic polynomial h and Q(x)&isin;L[x]. If L is totally split and A is the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve then
a description the genus 2 curve D such that A=(Jac)(D) is classically
known. See <A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_smith-phd">[Smi05]</A>, Chapter 8 for an exposition that is relatively
close to the description given here. See <A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_brudoe-44split">[BD09]</A> for a description
of D for general L.
<P>
In special cases, the codomain A can be a product of elliptic curves or the
Weil-restriction of an elliptic curve with respect to a quadratic extension of
k. In that case, the curve C has extra automorphisms that respects the
representation f(x)=c(Norm)<sub>L[x]/k[x]</sub> Q(x). and one can find the
relevant elliptic curves as quotients of C.

Computes the richelot isogenies defined over the basefield of the given
abelian varieties and returns a list of objects representing the codomains. If
the codomain is the Jacobian of a genus 2 curve, then that Jacobian is
returned or, if a curve is given instead of a Jacobian, the corresponding curve.
<P>
If the codomain is a product of elliptic curves, a Cartesian product of elliptic
curves is returned. If the codomain is the Weil restriction of an elliptic curve
relative to a quadratic extension, then the elliptic curve over the quadratic
extension is returned.
<P>
If <TT>Kernels</TT> is specified then a second list is returned, consisting of quadratic
polynomials over cubic algebras. Each describes the kernel of the relevant
isogeny.

Given a genus 2 Jacobian and a Richelot kernel, return the codomain.
The genus 2 curve must be given by a model of the form C:y<sup>2</sup>=f(x) and the
kernel must be a quadratic polynomial Q(x) over a cubic algebra L such that
(Norm)<sub>L[x]/k[x]</sub> Q(x)= cf(x). The elements of the second list returned
by <A  HREF = "text1492.htm#RichelotIsogenousSurfaces">RichelotIsogenousSurfaces</A> when given <TT>Kernels:=true</TT> are valid
kernel descriptions. The codomain is returned using the same conventions as

We will determine the Richelot isogenies on the Jacobian of y<sup>2</sup>=x<sup>5</sup> + x. This
Jacobian has the amusing property that there are 3 such isogenies and that
each of the types of codomain (Jacobian, Weil restriction, product of elliptic
curves) is represented.

Let us check that the norm of <TT>Q</TT> gives us x<sup>5</sup> + x again and that calling
<A  HREF = "text1492.htm#RichelotIsogenousSurface">RichelotIsogenousSurface</A> allows us to recreate the corresponding
codomain.

We can use Q to recreate the corresponding codomain.

Finally, to verify that the computed abelian surfaces are all isogenous, we
verify that their L-series over Q are equal. For each type of return value
we have to create the L-Series in a slightly different way, but once done, 
we can easily check that their coefficients agree.
