The Cox ring of a toric variety X is a polynomial ring whose variables
are in bijection with the 1-skeleton of the fan of X together with
three sequences of additional data:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(1)</DT><DD>a sequence of the components of an ideal called <I>the irrelevant ideal</I>;
<DT>(2)</DT><DD>a sequence of integral lattice points determining weights of
G<sub>m</sub> actions, called the <I><B>Z</I> weights</B>;
<DT>(3)</DT><DD>a sequence of rational lattice points determining weights of finite
cyclic group actions, called the <I>quotient weights</I>.
<P>
</DL>
When the Cox ring of a toric variety is displayed in Magma,
all nontrivial data is also printed, but any sequences that
are empty are omitted.
<P>
Cox rings provide a powerful way to construct toric varieties: under
some mild conditions, specification of data of this nature
determines a toric variety.

We build the weighted projective space P<sup>2</sup>(1, 2, 3).
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; P&lt;x,y,z&gt; := ProjectiveSpace(Rationals(),[1,2,3]);
</PRE>
The Cox ring of P<sup>2</sup>(1, 2, 3) is the usual homogeneous coordinate ring,
graded by the weights 1, 2, 3 of the space---that is, x has weight 1,
y has weight 2 and z has weight 3.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; CoxRing(P);
Cox ring with underlying Graded Polynomial ring of rank 3 over Rational Field
Order: Graded Reverse Lexicographical
Variables: x, y, z
Variable weights: [1, 2, 3]
The irrelevant ideal is:
    (x, y, z)
The grading is:
    1, 2, 3
</PRE>
The irrelevant ideal is the usual one for projective spaces: it
decrees that (0, 0, 0) is not a point of P<sup>2</sup> since it lies
in the locus defined by the irrelevant ideal.

We build a toric variety X<sub>2</sub> whose fan resembles that of P<sup>2</sup>.

&gt; X2&lt;u,v,w&gt; := ToricVariety(Rationals(),F2);
</PRE>
However, X is not isomorphic to P<sup>2</sup>. The small catch is that
the 1-skeleton of the fan F<sub>2</sub> that we defined (in other words, those
three vectors (1, 2), ( - 2, - 1) and (1, - 1)) does not generate
the lattice N, but only a sublattice.
So X will be the quotient of P<sup>2</sup> by some finite group action.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; CoxRing(X2);
Cox ring with underlying Polynomial ring of rank 3 over Rational Field
Order: Lexicographical
Variables: u, v, w
The irrelevant ideal is:
    (w, v, u)
The quotient grading is:
    1/3( 0, 2, 1 )
The integer grading is:
         1, 1, 1
</PRE>
The returned data are very similar to those for the Cox ring of P<sup>2</sup>.
The difference is in the third piece of data: a sequence
containing the single element 1/3(0, 2, 1).
This indicates that X is the quotient of P<sup>2</sup> by the
action of Z/3 given by
<P>
&epsilon;: (u, v, w) |-&gt; (u, &epsilon;<sup>2</sup> v, &epsilon; w).

where &epsilon; is a cube-root of unity.

The introduction to this section describes Cox rings in abstract

<P>
<P>
It is simple either to recover a toric variety from a
Cox ring (if one exists at all) or the fan and associated
lattice machinery corresponding to the toric variety.
The algorithm is straightforward: use the <B>Z</B> weights
to determine the rays of a fan and then the irrelevant
ideal to construct the rest of the cone structure of the
fan. The quotient weights may then require the lattice
to be extended to a larger lattice but containing the
same fan.
With this point of view, the Cox ring can be regarded
as the primary collection of data of a toric variety.


<H5><A NAME = "15888">ToricVariety(C) : RngCox -&gt; TorVar</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The toric variety whose Cox ring is C. It is not checked whether the Cox
data defines a toric variety; if you are unsure, you should ask for the fan.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME = "15889">Example <TT>Toric_toric-from-cox-example (H124E14)</TT></A></H3>
Sometimes, rather than defining a fan, it is easier to construct
a Cox ring first and build a toric variety from that.
