The p-adic field Q<sub>p</sub> arises naturally as the completion of Q with
respect to an absolute value function |x|<sub>p</sub> = p<sup> - v<sub>p</sub>(x)</sup>, where v<sub>p</sub>(x) is
the p-adic <I>valuation</I> of x (that is, a power of p such that x =
p<sup>v<sub>p</sub>(x)</sup> (a /b) but p not  | ab).  The <I>ring of integers</I> of
Q<sub>p</sub>, denoted Z<sub>p</sub>, is the set of all elements of non-negative valuation.
The ring Z<sub>p</sub> has a unique maximal ideal, generated by the prime p; the
<I>residue class field</I> K is the quotient Z<sub>p</sub> / p Z<sub>p</sub>.  Any element x
of Q<sub>p</sub> can be expressed as a power series in the prime p, so that x =
&sum;<sub>i=v</sub><sup>&infin;</sup> a<sub>i</sub> p<sup>i</sup>, where v is the valuation of x, a<sub>v</sub> is
non-zero, and each a<sub>i</sub> is a lift of an element from the residue class
field.  In more general terms, Q<sub>p</sub> is a local field, with its ring of
integers Z<sub>p</sub> being a local ring.  A uniformizer &pi; of Q<sub>p</sub> is the prime
p.
<P>
More generally, consider an irreducible polynomial over some local field L<sub>1</sub>
(such as Q<sub>p</sub>).  Then the extension given by adjoining a root &alpha; of
this polynomial to L<sub>1</sub>, L<sub>2</sub> = L<sub>1</sub>[&alpha;], is also a local field.  Let
&pi;<sub>1</sub> and &pi;<sub>2</sub> be uniformizers of L<sub>1</sub> and L<sub>2</sub>, respectively.  Then
&pi;<sub>2</sub><sup>e</sup> = &pi;<sub>1</sub> u, where u is a unit of L<sub>2</sub>.  The number e is the <I>ramification degree</I> of L<sub>2</sub> over L<sub>1</sub>, and divides the degree n of the
extension.  If e = n, we say L<sub>2</sub> is <I>totally ramified</I> over L<sub>1</sub>; if
e = 1, we say L<sub>2</sub> is <I>unramified</I> over L<sub>1</sub>.  The degree of the
residue class field K<sub>2</sub> of L<sub>2</sub> over the residue class field K<sub>1</sub> of L<sub>1</sub>
is f = (n /e).  Finite extensions in Magma must be either <I>unramified</I> or <I>totally ramified</I>; Magma also allows towers of extensions
to be built.
<P>
It is well known that up to isomorphism there is only one degree n
unramified extension of L, which can be obtained by adjoining a p<sup>n</sup> - 1-th
root of unity &zeta; to L.  This extension is Galois, with Galois group
isomorphic to the cyclic group of order n.  The Galois group is generated
by the Frobenius
automorphism &sigma;, which takes &zeta; to &zeta;<sup>p</sup>.  For some
applications, it is necessary to have a fast Frobenius action, so Magma
supports such a representation.  However, the defining polynomial in this
representation is particularly dense and can be expensive to construct, hence
it is ill-suited for general applications.  An unramified extension can only
be defined by <I>inertial</I> polynomials, which are polynomials that are
irreducible over the residue class field.  Magma allows an unramified
extension to be defined by any inertial polynomial.
<P>
All totally ramified extensions contain a root of an Eisenstein polynomial of
L.  An Eisenstein polynomial f(x) = &sum;<sub>i=0</sub><sup>n</sup> a<sub>i</sub> x<sup>i</sup> satisfies
v<sub>&pi;</sub>(a<sub>n</sub>) = 0, v<sub>&pi;</sub>(a<sub>i</sub>) &ge;1 for all 0 &lt; i &lt; n, and v<sub>&pi;</sub>(a<sub>0</sub>) =
1.  Magma allows a totally ramified extension to be defined by any
Eisenstein polynomial; note that this does not allow arbitrary
representations of totally
ramified extensions to be constructed.
