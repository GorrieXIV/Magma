This chapter describes all the basic operations available for creating and
working with matrices.  Matrices arise in many different contexts
and there are several types of matrix within Magma,
but most of the operations listed here apply to all types of matrix.
<P>
The parent of any matrix will be one of several types of
matrix-structure (module, matrix algebra, matrix group, etc.), and each of
these matrix-structure types are described in other chapters, together with
operations peculiar to their elements.
