In the invariant theory package of Magma, a linear algebraic group
G is given by polynomials, say in variables t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>m</sub>,
defined over some field K that is representable in Magma, as the
affine variety over the algebraic closure bar(K) of K given by these
polynomials. A G-module is given by a matrix A &isin;K[t<sub>1</sub>, ..., t<sub>m</sub>]<sup>n x n</sup> such that a group element
(&eta;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &eta;<sub>m</sub>) &isin;G acts on bar(K)<sup>n</sup> by the matrix
obtained by substituting (&eta;<sub>1</sub>, ..., &eta;<sub>m</sub>) into the polynomials
occurring in the matrix A.
<P>
G then also acts on the ring of polynomials on bar(K)<sup>n</sup> by
<P>
&sigma;(f) = f <IMG SRC="open.gif" ALT="" WIDTH=7 HEIGHT=7> &sigma;<sup> - 1</sup>
<P>
for &sigma; &isin;G and f &isin;bar(K)[x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>]. Since the
algorithms in Magma do not work with the algebraic closure, single
group elements are never dealt with. In fact, all relevant algorithms
ony involve field elements of K, the field of definition.
