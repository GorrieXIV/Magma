<P>
<P>
<P>
The automorphism group A of an incidence structure D is always
presented as a permutation group G acting on the standard support. 
The reasons for this include the fact that the support chosen 
when computing the automorphism group is often quite complicated. 
Further, if the group is represented as acting on a set of objects 
relating to the incidence structure, printed permutations are often 
unreadable. The support used when constructing the automorphism
group of an incidence structure D is either the point set of D
(when D is simple), or the disjoint union of the point set with
the block set (when D has repeated blocks).
<P>
The automorphism group G of D does not act directly on D.
Instead, G-sets are used to transfer the action of G to various
sets associated with D. The two most important G-sets, 
corresponding to action of G on the point set and on the block set, 
are returned by each of the functions provided for constructing
automorphism group or some specified subgroup of it.
<P>
In some circumstances, rather than viewing automorphisms as
group elements, it is desirable to view them is as mappings 
of D into itself. Associated with each incidence structure
is a mapping structure, Aut(D), which denotes the set of
automorphisms of D. Note that Aut(D) is the <I>parent</I> 
of the automorphisms of G so that the function <TT>Aut(D)</TT> 
simply creates a shell structure rather than the actual 
automorphism group of D. A transfer map is provided to convert 
a permutation of the automorphism group G into a mapping 
belonging to Aut(D).

Construct the automorphism group G of the incidence structure D. 
The set on which G acts depends upon whether or not the design is
simple. Suppose D has v points and b blocks.  If the incidence 
structure D is simple, the automorphism group is constructed in 
its action on the points of D. It is returned acting on the standard 
support { 1, ..., v }, where i corresponds to
the i-th point of D. If D is not simple, it is constructed in
its action of the disjoint union of the point set and block set of D.
Again, it is returned acting on the standard support 
{ 1, ..., v+b }, where 1 &le;i &le;v corresponds 
to the i-th point of D and v + 1 &le;i &le;v + b corresponds 
to the (i - v)-th point of D.
The function returns:
<DL COMPACT class='compact'>
<DT>(i)</DT><DD>The automorphism group G of D as described above;
<DT>(ii)</DT><DD>A G-set Y corresponding to the action of G on the point
set of D.

set of D.
<DT>(iv)</DT><DD>The Aut structure S for D; and
<DT>(v)</DT><DD>A transfer map t : G -&gt; S.
<P>
<P>
</DL>
Given a permutation g of G, t(g) is the <I>mapping</I> of D into 
itself that corresponds to the automorphism group element g.
The G-sets Y and W should be used whenever it is necessary
to have G act on the points or lines of D.

As noted at the beginning of the section, the automorphism group G of
an incidence structure D is given in its action on the standard
support and it does not act directly on D. The action of G on
D is obtained using the G-set mechanism. The two basic G-sets
associated with D correspond to the action of G on the set of 
points P and the set of blocks B of D. These two G-sets are
given as return values of the function <TT>AutomorphismGroup</TT> or
may be constructed directly. Additional G-sets associated with
D may be built using the G-set constructors. Given a G-set
Y for G, the action of G on Y may be studied using the
permutation group functions that allow a G-set as an argument.
In this section, only a few of the available functions are 
described: see the section on G-sets for a complete list.
