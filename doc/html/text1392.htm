Recall from Section <A  HREF = "text1389.htm#15553">Key Warning and Disclaimer</A> that, despite some ambiguity,
we regard the following as being equivalent:  polarised varieties
X, A; schemes in wps X&sub;P<sup>N</sup>(w<sub>0</sub>, ..., w<sub>N</sub>)
where A is a degree 1 hyperplane section; and data about the
Hilbert series of the graded ring R(X, A).
Thus we constantly refer to a <I>polarised variety X</I>,
and we expect to be able to retrieve its Hilbert series, its
dimension, the codimension of its embedding and other such data.
<P>
With one exception, the intrinsics described in this section
can be applied to all polarised varieties.
The exception is the following little-used intrinsic that
creates a polarised variety that is not of a specific type.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The basket of singularities of the polarised variety X in
sequence format, that is, the basket is a sequence of sequences,
in which a singularity oneover(r)(a, b, c) is represented as a
sequence [r, a, b, c] of integers.  (The Gorenstein surface
singularity oneover(r)(a, r - a) admits further abbreviation to [r, a].)
Notice that the local polarisation n is not included in
this raw basket data; its default value n= - 1 is assumed.

<H5><A NAME = "15625">NoetherWeights(X) : GRSch -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The weights corresponding to a Noether normalisation of the
polarised variety X.  In other words, these are the weights
of polynomials in the graded ring of X that generate a
polynomial subring of maximal dimension.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15626">NoetherNumerator(X) : GRSch -&gt; RngUPolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The numerator n(t) of the Hilbert series P(t) of the polarised
variety X when expressed as a rational function
P=n(t)/ &amp; * [1 - t<sup>w</sup> : w &isin;N ], where the product in the
denominator is taken over N, the sequence of Noether weights of X.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15627">NoetherNormalisation(X) : GRSch -&gt; Tup</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a polarised variety X return a pair, the first term of which 
is the sequence of Noether weights, the second the corresponding numerator.

The coefficients of the Hilbert series of the polarised variety X
expressed as a power series.  The number of coefficients returned 
is equal to the precision of the power series ring in which the Hilbert
series was expanded.

<H5>BettiNumbers(X) : GRSch -&gt; RngIntElt</H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If n(t) is the Hilbert numerator of X and is of the form
<P>
n = 1 - &sum;<sub>i=1</sub><sup>N<sub>0</sub></sup> a<sub>0, i</sub> t<sup>i</sup> + &sum;<sub>k=N<sub>0</sub> + 1</sub><sup>N<sub>1</sub></sup> a<sub>1, i</sub> t<sup>i</sup>

      + ( - 1)<sup>k</sup> t<sup>N<sub>k</sub></sup>
<P>
then the apparent codimension of X is k, the apparent equation degrees
are given by those i for which a<sub>0, i</sub> is nonzero (with a<sub>0, i</sub> equations
of that degree i) and the apparent syzygy degrees are those integers i for
which a<sub>1, i</sub> is nonzero.  The Betti numbers are a sequence with first 
element the sum of all a<sub>0, i</sub>, second element the sum of all a<sub>1, i</sub>, 
and so on until a<sub>k - 1, i</sub>.

Procedural versions of intrinsic functions modify polarised varieties at
the generic level because they preserve any subtypes;  functional
versions exist for special types of polarised variety but not in general.


<H5><A NAME = "15632">X eq Y : GRSch,GRSch -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return <TT>true</TT> if and only if the polarised varieties X and Y have the
same dimension, weights, basket and Hilbert numerator.
In particular, these conditions imply that X and Y have the
same Hilbert series.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15633">CheckCodimension(X) : GRSch -&gt; BoolElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Return <TT>true</TT> if and only if the codimension of X is equal to the
apparent codimension of X determined by its Hilbert numerator.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15634">FirstWeights(X) : GRSch -&gt; SeqEnum</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These are weights assigned to the polarised variety X during its
construction that carry some relevance; if no such weights were
assigned, the usual weights of X will be returned.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15635">IncludeWeight(~X,w) : GRSch,RngIntElt -&gt;</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Include the positive integer w among the weights of X,
adjusting all other data associated to the embedding
of X as required.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15636">RemoveWeight(~X,w) : GRSch,RngIntElt -&gt;</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remove the positive integer w from the weights of X,
assuming it appears there and can be removed without
destroying the property of the Hilbert numerator being a
polynomial. All other data associated to the embedding of X 
is modified as required.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "15637">MinimiseWeights(~X) : GRSch -&gt;</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Remove any weights from X whose presence is not required
to keep the Hilbert numerator of X a polynomial.
