In this chapter we will present the categories of finite
projective and affine planes. 
<P>
The category names for projective and affine planes are <TT>PlaneProj</TT>
and <TT>PlaneAff</TT> respectively. Within each of these categories we have what
we will call <I>classical</I> planes --- those which are defined by a 
vector space of dimension 2 (for affine planes) or 3 (for projective
planes).
<P>
Some functions documented here apply to all types of planes, others
are specific to projective, affine or classical planes.
It should be clear which is the case for each entry.

A point of a plane is considered to be a special object, and so
points are given their own special type, <TT>PlanePt</TT>, in Magma.
This allows the points of a plane to be defined over any type of
Magma object, and also improves the efficiency of the code.
<P>
A special structure called the <I>point--set</I> acts as the parent structure
for points.  A point is created by coercing an appropriate Magma
object into the point--set. It is also possible the get the i-th point,
or a random point, from the point--set.
<P>
Similarly, lines of a plane have a special type <TT>PlaneLn</TT>, and
the <I>line--set</I> acts as their parent structure.
Lines can be created by coercing a suitable object into the line--set,
or by asking for the i-th line, or a random line, from the line--set.
