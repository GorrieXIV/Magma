This section describes some basic functionality for homomorphisms between sheaves 
defined on the same scheme. A sheaf homomorphism is represented by a module 
homomorphism between representing modules (defining, maximal or global section 
modules) for the two sheaves. Strictly, only (degree 0) homomorphisms that 
preserve the module gradings should be allowed but, for flexibility, we allow 
"homogeneous" homomorphisms that uniformly shift the grading by d and should 
be thought of as sheaf homomorphisms from the domain sheaf to the dth Serre 
twist of the codomain sheaf. We then say that the homomorphism is of degree d 
as for module homomorphisms.
<P>
There are some basic constructors and accessor functions, a function to "expand" a
chain of homomorphisms to a single homomorphism and image, kernel and cokernel
functions. The type of a sheaf homomorphism is <TT>ShfHom</TT>. Note that this is
NOT a <TT>Map</TT> subtype, so that a sheaf homomorphism doesn't automatically
inherit all of the usual map properties.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given sheaves S and T on the same scheme X and a module homomorphism h
between M<sub>0</sub> and N<sub>0</sub>, this function returns a sheaf homomorphism from S to
T.  Here M<sub>0</sub> is one of the defining, maximal or global section modules of 
S and N<sub>0</sub> is a similar module for T. The homomorphism h must be a 
homogeneous module homomorphism as returned by <TT>IsHomogeneous</TT> and if 
d is its degree then the homomorphism returned is really one from S to 
T(d) in the category of OX-sheaves.

<H5><A NAME = "14877">Domain(f) : ShfHom -&gt; ShfCoh</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The domain of the sheaf homomorphism f.

<H5><A NAME = "14878">Codomain(f) : ShfHom -&gt; ShfCoh</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The codomain of the sheaf homomorphism f.

<H5><A NAME = "14879">Degree(f) : ShfHom -&gt; RngIntElt</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The degree of the sheaf homomorphism f as defined in the 
introduction to this section.

<H5><A NAME = "14880">ModuleHomomorphism(f) : ShfHom -&gt; ModMPolHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The underlying homogeneous graded module homomorphism of the sheaf 
homomorphism f.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14881">Kernel(f) : ShfHom -&gt; ShfCoh, ShfHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sheaf homomorphism f, this function returns the kernel of f and 
its inclusion homomorphism into the domain of f.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H5><A NAME = "14882">Image(f) : ShfHom -&gt; ShfCoh, ShfHom, ShfHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sheaf f, this function returns the image, I, of f and two sheaf 
homomorphisms g and h.  If f has degree d and S, T are its domain 
and codomain, then I is a subsheaf of T(d). The second return value g is 
the restriction of f from S to I and the third return value h is the 
inclusion of I in T(d), so that g also has degree d and h has 
degree 0.

<H5><A NAME = "14883">Cokernel(f) : ShfHom -&gt; ShfCoh, ShfHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Given a sheaf homomorphism f, this function returns the cokernel of f 
and also the quotient homomorphism from the codomain to it.
<P>
Strictly speaking, if f has degree d and S, T are its domain and codomain,
here we are taking f to be a homomorphism from S(d) &lt;- T rather than
from S &lt;- T(d).

<H5><A NAME = "14884">Expand(hms) : SeqEnum[ShfHom] -&gt; ShfHom</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
If hms = [h<sub>1</sub>, ..., h<sub>n</sub>] is a sequence of sheaf homomorphisms, then this 
function returns the composition of homomorphisms h<sub>1</sub> * h<sub>2</sub> * ... h<sub>n</sub>. 
The domain of h<sub>2</sub> must be the codomain of h<sub>1</sub> etc. and the stronger 
condition that the underlying module homomorphisms must be composable also 
holds. So the domain of <TT>ModuleHomomorphism(h2)</TT> must be the codomain of 
<TT>ModuleHomomorphism(h1)</TT> etc.
