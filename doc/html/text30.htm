This chapter is concerned with the various facilities provided for communication
between Magma and its environment. The first section describes character
strings and their operations.  Following this, the various forms of the 
<TT>print</TT>-statement are presented. Next the file type is introduced and
its operations summarized. The chapter concludes with a section listing
system calls. These include facilities that allow the user to execute
an operating system command from within Magma or to run an external process.
