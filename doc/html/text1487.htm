The problem is to construct a curve of genus 2 from a given set of
Igusa--Clebsch invariants defined over the same field as the field of
moduli (simply the smallest field in which the invariants lie).
Mestre <A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_mestre_inv">[Mes91]</A> shows that this is not always possible, even
in theory. But over a finite field or the rationals he gives a method
for deciding whether it is possible and if it is, for finding such a
curve. Mestre's algorithm was implemented by P. Gaudry. Mestre's
algorithm does not work when the curve has a split Jacobian. Cardona 
and Quer <A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_cardona">[CQ05]</A> showed that in this case one can always find 
a curve defined over the field of moduli and gave equations for such 
a curve. This works over any field of characteristic not 2, 3 or 5.
<P>
In any characteristic, the code package of Lercier and Ritzenthaler
produces a genus 2 curve from a given set of Cardona-Quer-Nart-Pujola
invariants (see Subsection <A  HREF = "text1486.htm#16790">Igusa Invariants</A>).
They use the work of Cardona and Quer cited in the previous
paragraph in the odd characteristic case, with some extra work for 
characteristics 3 and 5. In characteristic 2, they use the models from
<A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_CaNaPu_g2">[CNP05]</A>.
<P>
Lercier and Ritzenthaler have also contributed a package for
genus 3 hyperelliptic curves that produces a curve from a given set of
Shioda invariants (see Subsection <A  HREF = "text1486.htm#16807">Shioda Invariants</A>).
This works in characteristic not 2, 3, 5 or 7.
<P>
Over a field of characteristic zero, the equation of the curve 
returned by these methods can involve huge coefficients.   
For curves over the rationals, this curve can be processed by the 
algorithm of P. Wamelen <A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_wam_red">[Wam99]</A> and <A  HREF = "text1482.htm#bib_wam_code">[Wam01]</A>.  
While, in practice, this algorithm often produces a curve with much
smaller coefficients, for certain curves the algorithm may not 
significantly reduce their size.

This attempts to build a curve of genus 2 with the given Igusa-Clebsch
invariants (see Subsection <A  HREF = "text1486.htm#16790">Igusa Invariants</A>) by Mestre's
algorithm (and Cardona's in case of non-hyperelliptic involutions)
defined over the field F in which the invariants lie. Currently this
field must be the rationals, a number field, or a finite field of characteristic 
greater than 5.  If there exists no such curve defined over F, then either 
a curve over some quadratic extension is returned (when F is the rationals), 
or an error results (when F is a number field). 
<P>
When the base field is the rationals, the parameter <TT>Reduce</TT> 
invokes Wamelen's reduction algorithm, and is equivalent to a call 
to <TT>ReducedModel</TT> with the algorithm specified as <TT>"Wamelen"</TT>.

From a given sequence of Cardona-Quer-Nart-Pujola invariants (as
described in Subsection <A  HREF = "text1486.htm#16790">Igusa Invariants</A>) over a finite
field or the rationals, return a genus 2 curve with these absolute invariants.
This works in all characteristics as noted in the introduction to the
section. The geometric automorphism group is also returned as a
finitely-presented group.

Given a sequence of 9 Shioda invariants JI over the rationals or a finite field k, the first
intrinsic returns a genus 3 hyperelliptic curve over k with these invariants.
The abstract geometric automorphism group is also returned as a permutation group.
This will cause an error if JI are singular Shioda invariants.
<P>
The second intrinsic also works for singular invariants.
It returns a polynomial f of degree &le;8 with the given invariants. If JI
are non-singular, y<sup>2</sup>=f(x) is a genus 3 curve with invariants JI.
