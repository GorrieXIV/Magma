The Hasse--Minkowski principle for quadratic forms implies that a
conic has a point over a number field if and only if it has a point
over its completion at every finite and infinite prime.
This provides an effective set of conditions for determining whether
a conic has a point: Only the finite number of primes dividing the
discriminant of the curve need to be checked, and by Hensel's lemma
it is only necessary to check this condition to finite precision.
The theory holds over any global field (a number field or the
function field of a curve over a finite field) but the algorithms
implemented at present only treat the field Q.

We say that p is a ramified or bad prime for a conic C
if there exists no p-integral model for C with nonsingular
reduction.  Every such prime is a divisor of the coefficients of
the Legendre polynomial.  However, in general it is not possible
to have a Legendre model whose coefficients are divisible only
by the ramified primes.  We use the term ramified or bad prime
for a conic to refer to the local properties of C which are
independent of the models.

Given a conic C over the rationals, returns the sequence of
the finite ramified primes of C: Those at which C has intrinsic
locally singular reduction. This uses quaternion algebras.
<P>
<P>
N.B. Although the infinite prime is not included, the data of
whether or not C/Q is ramified at infinity is carried by the
length of this sequence.  The number of bad primes, including
infinity, must be even so the parity of the sequence length
specifies the ramification information at infinity.

By computing the Hilbert symbol at all bad primes, it is possible
to determine whether a conic is <I>globally</I> soluble.  This is
an easier problem than finding a global solution.

This returns <TT>true</TT> if and only if the conic has points over all completions

Hilbert's norm residue symbol gives a precise condition for a 
quadratic form to represent zero over a local field (equivalently,
for a conic to have points over that field).
<P>
An explicit treatment of the properties and theory of the norm
residue symbol can be found in Cassels <A  HREF = "text1414.htm#bib_Cassels78">[Cas78]</A>; the
Hilbert symbol is treated by Lam <A  HREF = "text1414.htm#bib_Lam73">[Lam73]</A>.

Given two rational numbers or integers a and b, and a prime p,

Computes the Hilbert symbol (a, b)<sub>p</sub>,
where a and b are elements of a number field and p is either a prime
number (if a, b &isin;Q) or a prime ideal.
For a, b &isin;Q, by default Magma uses <TT>NormResidueSymbol</TT> to compute
the Hilbert symbol;
one may insist on instead using the same algorithm as for number fields by
setting the optional argument <TT>Al</TT> to <TT>"Evaluate"</TT>.

In the following example we show how the norm residue symbols can
be used to determine the bad primes of a conic.
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; P2&lt;x,y,z&gt; := ProjectiveSpace(RationalField(), 2);
&gt; a := 234;
&gt; b := -33709;
&gt; c := 127;
&gt; C := Conic(P2, a*x^2 + b*y^2 + c*z^2);
&gt; HasRationalPoint(C);
false
&gt; fac := Factorization(Integers()!Discriminant(C));
&gt; fac;
[ &lt;2, 3&gt;, &lt;3, 2&gt;, &lt;13, 2&gt;, &lt;127, 1&gt;, &lt;2593, 1&gt; ]
</PRE>
So we only need to test the primes 2, 3, 13, 127 and 2593.
By scaling the defining polynomial of the curve ax<sup>2</sup> + by<sup>2</sup> + cz<sup>2</sup> = 0
by -1/c, we obtain the quadratic form -a/c x<sup>2</sup> - b/c y<sup>2</sup> - z<sup>2</sup>;
this means that we want to check the Hilbert symbols for the coefficient
pair ( - a/c, - b/c).
<P>
<P>
<PRE>
&gt; [ NormResidueSymbol(-a/c, -b/c, p[1]) : p in fac ];
[ -1, 1, 1, -1, 1 ];
</PRE>
The norm residue symbol indicates that only 2 and 127 have
no local p-adic solutions, which confirms the bad primes as
reported by Magma:
