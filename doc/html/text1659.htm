There is a feature to store spaces that have been computed over a particular field.
This typically saves a lot of time in many of the routines, because the algorithms
use precomputations and data from existing spaces over the same field.  However,
these objects also occupy a lot of memory.
<P>
By default, no caching is done; the user must manually set it for each field.
It is recommended to always do this when the field is created, and then clear
the cache whenever memory usage becomes a concern.
<P>
Note: in earlier versions (prior to V2.20) caching was always switched on 
for Hilbert modular forms.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If v is <TT>true</TT>, modular forms over the field F that are created afterwards
will be cached.
If v is <TT>false</TT>, the existing cache is made empty and caching is switched off.

<H5><A NAME = "18564">ClearStoredModularForms(F) : Fld -&gt;</A></H5>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
The cache of modular forms over the field F is made empty.  If caching was switched on
for F, it remains switched on.
