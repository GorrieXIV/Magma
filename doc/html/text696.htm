In addition to the functionality explained in
Chapter <A  HREF = "text684.htm#7895">MATRIX GROUPS OVER INFINITE FIELDS</A> and the functions that are available for all
finite (matrix) groups, Magma can also compute normalizers and
centralizers of a finite integral matrix group G in GL<sub>n</sub>(Z) as
well as decide conjugacy in GL<sub>n</sub>(Z) and GL<sub>n</sub>(Q).
<P>
These algorithms are based on the sublattice machinery (see Section
<A  HREF = "text334.htm#3246">G-invariant Sublattices</A>) and the enumeration of G-perfect forms.
They are explained in <A  HREF = "text694.htm#bib_plesken_acta">[OPS98]</A>, <A  HREF = "text694.htm#bib_opgenorth">[Opg01]</A>. The algorithms 
perform very well, as long as the space of G-invariant symmetric
forms has small dimension (say less than 15) and the index of the 
groups in their Bravais groups is not too large.
<P>
The databases of maximal finite irreducible rational, integral, 
symplectic and quaternionic matrix groups are explained in 
Chapter <A  HREF = "text742.htm#8510">DATABASES OF GROUPS</A>.
