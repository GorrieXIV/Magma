A finitely presented algebra (fp-algebra) in Magma is simply
the quotient ring of a free algebra F = R&lt; x<sub>1</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub> &gt; 
by an ideal J of F. It is an object of type <A NAME = "AlgFP"><TT>AlgFP</TT></A> with
elements of type <A NAME = "AlgFPElt"><TT>AlgFPElt</TT></A>.
<P>
The elements of fp-algebras are simply noncommutative polynomials
which are always kept reduced to normal form modulo the ideal J of
"relations".  Practically all operations which are applicable to
noncommutative polynomials are also applicable in Magma to elements
of fp-algebras (when meaningful).
<P>
If an fp-algebra A has finite dimension, considered as a vector space
over its coefficient field, then extra special operations are available
for A and its elements.
